# Lantern Vector Store (auto-retriever) 
This guide shows how to perform **auto-retrieval** in LlamaIndex.
Many popular vector DBs support a set of metadata filters in addition to a query string for semantic search. Given a natural language query, we first use the LLM to infer a set of metadata filters as well as the right query string to pass to the vector DB (either can also be blank). This overall query bundle is then executed against the vector DB.
This allows for more dynamic, expressive forms of retrieval beyond top-k semantic search. The relevant context for a given query may only require filtering on a metadata tag, or require a joint combination of filtering + semantic search within the filtered set, or just raw semantic search.
We demonstrate an example with Lantern, but auto-retrieval is also implemented with many other vector DBs (e.g. Pinecone, Chroma, Weaviate, and more).
If you’re opening this Notebook on colab, you will probably need to install LlamaIndex 🦙.

```


%pip install llama-index-vector-stores-lantern


```


```


!pip install llama-index psycopg2-binary asyncpg


```


```


import logging




import sys





logging.basicConfig(stream=sys.stdout, level=logging.INFO)




logging.getLogger().addHandler(logging.StreamHandler(stream=sys.stdout))


```


```

# set up OpenAI



import os





os.environ["OPENAI_API_KEY"] ="<your-api-key>"





import openai





openai.api_key = os.environ["OPENAI_API_KEY"]


```


```


import psycopg2




from sqlalchemy import make_url





connection_string ="postgresql://postgres:postgres@localhost:5432"





url = make_url(connection_string)





db_name ="postgres"




conn = psycopg2.connect(connection_string)




conn.autocommit =True


```


```


from llama_index.core import VectorStoreIndex, StorageContext




from llama_index.vector_stores.lantern import LanternVectorStore

```

## Build Vector Index with Lantern Vector Store
[Section titled “Build Vector Index with Lantern Vector Store”](https://developers.llamaindex.ai/python/framework/integrations/vector_stores/lanternautoretriever/#build-vector-index-with-lantern-vector-store)
Here we load the data into the vector store. As mentioned above, both the text and metadata for each node will get converted into corresponding representations in Lantern. We can now run semantic queries and also metadata filtering on this data from Lantern.

```


vector_store = LanternVectorStore.from_params(




database=db_name,




host=url.host,




password=url.password,




port=url.port,




user=url.username,




table_name="famous_people",




embed_dim=1536# openai embedding dimension




m=16# HNSW M parameter




ef_construction=128# HNSW ef construction parameter




ef=64# HNSW ef search parameter






storage_context = StorageContext.from_defaults(vector_store=vector_store)


```


```


index = VectorStoreIndex(nodes, storage_context=storage_context)


```

## Define `VectorIndexAutoRetriever`
[Section titled “Define VectorIndexAutoRetriever”](https://developers.llamaindex.ai/python/framework/integrations/vector_stores/lanternautoretriever/#define-vectorindexautoretriever)
We define our core `VectorIndexAutoRetriever` module. The module takes in `VectorStoreInfo`, which contains a structured description of the vector store collection and the metadata filters it supports. This information will then be used in the auto-retrieval prompt where the LLM infers metadata filters.

```


from llama_index.core.retrievers import VectorIndexAutoRetriever




from llama_index.core.vector_stores import MetadataInfo, VectorStoreInfo






vector_store_info = VectorStoreInfo(




content_info="brief biography of celebrities",




metadata_info=[




MetadataInfo(




name="category",




type="str",




description=(




"Category of the celebrity, one of [Sports, Entertainment,"




" Business, Music]"






MetadataInfo(




name="country",




type="str",




description=(




"Country of the celebrity, one of [United States, Barbados,"




" Portugal]"








retriever = VectorIndexAutoRetriever(




index, vector_store_info=vector_store_info



```

## Running over some sample data
[Section titled “Running over some sample data”](https://developers.llamaindex.ai/python/framework/integrations/vector_stores/lanternautoretriever/#running-over-some-sample-data)
We try running over some sample data. Note how metadata filters are inferred - this helps with more precise retrieval!

```


retriever.retrieve("Tell me about two celebrities from United States")
