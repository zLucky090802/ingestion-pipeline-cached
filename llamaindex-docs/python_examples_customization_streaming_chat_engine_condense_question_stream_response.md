Paul Graham started an investment firm with Jessica after retiring from Y Combinator. They decided to create their own investment firm to implement the ideas they had been discussing. Paul funded the firm, allowing Jessica to quit her job and work for it, while also bringing on Robert and Trevor as partners. The firm was structured as an angel firm, which was a novel concept at the time. They aimed not only to make seed investments but also to provide comprehensive support to startups, similar to the help they had received when starting their own company. The investment firm was not organized as a fund and was funded with their own money. The distinctive aspect of their approach was the batch model, where they funded multiple startups at once and provided intensive support over a three-month period.

After that, the individual started working on Lisp again in March 2015. The distinctive aspect of Lisp is that its core is a language defined by writing an interpreter in itself. Initially intended as a formal model of computation, Lisp evolved into a programming language as well. The individual's interest in Lisp stemmed from its power and elegance derived from its origins as a model of computation.
