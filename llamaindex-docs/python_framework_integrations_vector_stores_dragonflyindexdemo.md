# Dragonfly and Vector Store 
In this notebook we are going to show a quick demo of using the Dragonfly with Vector Store.
If you’re opening this Notebook on colab, you will probably need to install LlamaIndex 🦙.

```

%pip install -U llama-index llama-index-vector-stores-redis llama-index-embeddings-cohere llama-index-embeddings-openai

```


```

import os


import getpass


import sys


import logging


import textwrap


import warnings



warnings.filterwarnings("ignore")



logging.basicConfig(stream=sys.stdout, level=logging.INFO)



from llama_index.core import VectorStoreIndex, SimpleDirectoryReader


from llama_index.vector_stores.redis import RedisVectorStore

```

### Start Dragonfly
[Section titled “Start Dragonfly”](https://developers.llamaindex.ai/python/framework/integrations/vector_stores/dragonflyindexdemo/#start-dragonfly)
The easiest way to start Dragonfly is using the Dragonfly docker image or quickly signing up for a [Dragonfly Cloud](https://www.dragonflydb.io/cloud) demo instance.
To follow every step of this tutorial, launch the image as follows:
Terminal window
```


dockerrun-d-p6379:6379--namedragonflydocker.dragonflydb.io/dragonflydb/dragonfly


```

### Setup OpenAI
[Section titled “Setup OpenAI”](https://developers.llamaindex.ai/python/framework/integrations/vector_stores/dragonflyindexdemo/#setup-openai)
Lets first begin by adding the openai api key. This will allow us to access openai for embeddings and to use chatgpt.

```

oai_api_key = getpass.getpass("OpenAI API Key:")


os.environ["OPENAI_API_KEY"] = oai_api_key

```

Download Data

```

!mkdir -p 'data/paul_graham/'


!wget 'https://raw.githubusercontent.com/run-llama/llama_index/main/docs/examples/data/paul_graham/paul_graham_essay.txt' -O 'data/paul_graham/paul_graham_essay.txt'

```

### Read in a dataset
[Section titled “Read in a dataset”](https://developers.llamaindex.ai/python/framework/integrations/vector_stores/dragonflyindexdemo/#read-in-a-dataset)
Here we will use a set of Paul Graham essays to provide the text to turn into embeddings, store in a vector store and query to find context for our LLM QnA loop.

```

# load documents


documents = SimpleDirectoryReader("./data/paul_graham").load_data()


print(



"Document ID:",




documents[0].id_,




"Document Filename:",




documents[0].metadata["file_name"],



```


```

Document ID: a5cae17c-27eb-411e-8967-fb6ef98bcdcf Document Filename: paul_graham_essay.txt

```

### Initialize the default vector store
[Section titled “Initialize the default vector store”](https://developers.llamaindex.ai/python/framework/integrations/vector_stores/dragonflyindexdemo/#initialize-the-default-vector-store)
Now we have our documents prepared, we can initialize the vector store with **default** settings. This will allow us to store our vectors in Dragonfly and create an index for real-time search.

```

from llama_index.core import StorageContext


from redis import Redis



# create a client connection


redis_client = Redis.from_url("redis://localhost:6379")



# create the vector store wrapper


vector_store = RedisVectorStore(redis_client=redis_client, overwrite=True)



# load storage context


storage_context = StorageContext.from_defaults(vector_store=vector_store)



# build and load index from documents and storage context


index = VectorStoreIndex.from_documents(



documents, storage_context=storage_context



```


```

14:41:31 llama_index.vector_stores.redis.base INFO   Added 22 documents to index llama_index

```

### Query the default vector store
[Section titled “Query the default vector store”](https://developers.llamaindex.ai/python/framework/integrations/vector_stores/dragonflyindexdemo/#query-the-default-vector-store)
Now that we have our data stored in the index, we can ask questions against the index.
The index will use the data as the knowledge base for an LLM. The default setting for as_query_engine() utilizes OpenAI embeddings and GPT as the language model. Therefore, an OpenAI key is required unless you opt for a customized or local language model.
Below we will test searches against out index and then full RAG with an LLM.

```

query_engine = index.as_query_engine()


retriever = index.as_retriever()

```


```

result_nodes = retriever.retrieve("What did the author learn?")


for node in result_nodes:



print(node)

### Use a custom index schema
[Section titled “Use a custom index schema”](https://developers.llamaindex.ai/python/framework/integrations/vector_stores/dragonflyindexdemo/#use-a-custom-index-schema)
In most use cases, you need the ability to customize the underling index configuration and specification. For example, this is handy in order to define specific metadata filters you wish to enable.
With Dragonfly, this is as simple as defining an index schema object (from file or dict) and passing it through to the vector store client wrapper.
For this example, we will:
  1. switch the embedding model to [Cohere](https://cohere.com/)
  2. add an additional metadata field for the document `updated_at` timestamp
  3. index the existing `file_name` metadata field



```

from llama_index.core.settings import Settings


from llama_index.embeddings.cohere import CohereEmbedding



# set up Cohere Key


co_api_key = getpass.getpass("Cohere API Key:")



Settings.embed_model = CohereEmbedding(api_key=co_api_key)

```


```

from redisvl.schema import IndexSchema




custom_schema = IndexSchema.from_dict(




# customize basic index specs




"index": {




"name": "paul_graham",




"prefix": "essay",




"key_separator": ":",





# customize fields that are indexed




"fields": [




# required fields for llamaindex

### Deleting documents or index completely
[Section titled “Deleting documents or index completely”](https://developers.llamaindex.ai/python/framework/integrations/vector_stores/dragonflyindexdemo/#deleting-documents-or-index-completely)
Sometimes it may be useful to delete documents or the entire index. This can be done using the `delete` and `delete_index` methods.

```

document_id = documents[0].doc_id


document_id

```


```

print("Number of documents before deleting", redis_client.dbsize())


vector_store.delete(document_id)


print("Number of documents after deleting", redis_client.dbsize())

```

However, the index still exists (with no associated documents).

```

vector_store.index_exists()

```


```

# now lets delete the index entirely


# this will delete all the documents and the index


vector_store.delete_index()

```


```

print("Number of documents after deleting", redis_client.dbsize())

```
