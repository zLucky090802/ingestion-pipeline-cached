# DataFrame Structured Data Extraction 
This demo shows how you can extract tabular DataFrames from raw text.
This was directly inspired by jxnl’s dataframe example here: <https://github.com/jxnl/openai_function_call/blob/main/auto_dataframe.py>.
We show this with different levels of complexity, all backed by the OpenAI Function API:
  * (more code) How to build an extractor yourself using our OpenAIPydanticProgram
  * (less code) Using our out-of-the-box `DFFullProgram` and `DFRowsProgram` objects


## Build a DF Extractor Yourself (Using OpenAIPydanticProgram)
[Section titled “Build a DF Extractor Yourself (Using OpenAIPydanticProgram)”](https://developers.llamaindex.ai/python/examples/output_parsing/df_program/#build-a-df-extractor-yourself-using-openaipydanticprogram)
Our OpenAIPydanticProgram is a wrapper around an OpenAI LLM that supports function calling - it will return structured outputs in the form of a Pydantic object.
We import our `DataFrame` and `DataFrameRowsOnly` objects.
To create an output extractor, you just need to 1) specify the relevant Pydantic object, and 2) Add the right prompt
If you’re opening this Notebook on colab, you will probably need to install LlamaIndex 🦙.

## Use our DataFrame Programs
[Section titled “Use our DataFrame Programs”](https://developers.llamaindex.ai/python/examples/output_parsing/df_program/#use-our-dataframe-programs)
We provide convenience wrappers for `DFFullProgram` and `DFRowsProgram`. This allows a simpler object creation interface than specifying all details through the `OpenAIPydanticProgram`.
