# Benchmarking LLM Evaluators On The MT-Bench Human Judgement `LabelledPairwiseEvaluatorDataset` 
In this notebook guide, we benchmark Gemini and GPT models as LLM evaluators using a slightly adapted version of the MT-Bench Human Judgements dataset. For this dataset, human evaluators compare two llm model responses to a given query and rank them according to their own preference. In the original version, there can be more than one human evaluator for a given example (query, two model responses). In the adapted version that we consider however, we aggregate these ‘repeated’ entries and convert the ‘winner’ column of the original schema to instead represent the proportion of times ‘model_a’ wins across all of the human evaluators. To adapt this to a llama-dataset, and to better consider ties (albeit with small samples) we set an uncertainty threshold for this proportion in that if it is between [0.4, 0.6] then we consider there to be no winner between the two models. We download this dataset from [llama-hub](https://llamahub.ai). Finally, the LLMs that we benchmark are listed below:
  1. GPT-3.5 (OpenAI)
  2. GPT-4 (OpenAI)
  3. Gemini-Pro (Google)

### Benchmark With `EvaluatorBenchmarkerPack` (llama-pack)
[Section titled “Benchmark With EvaluatorBenchmarkerPack (llama-pack)”](https://developers.llamaindex.ai/python/examples/evaluation/mt_bench_human_judgement/#benchmark-with-evaluatorbenchmarkerpack-llama-pack)
To compare our four evaluators we will benchmark them against `MTBenchHumanJudgementDataset`, wherein references are provided by human evaluators. The benchmarks will return the following quantites:
  * `number_examples`: The number of examples the dataset consists of.
  * `invalid_predictions`: The number of evaluations that could not yield a final evaluation (e.g., due to inability to parse the evaluation output, or an exception thrown by the LLM evaluator)
  * `inconclusives`: Since this is a pairwise comparison, to mitigate the risk for “position bias” we conduct two evaluations — one with original order of presenting the two model answers, and another with the order in which these answers are presented to the evaluator LLM is flipped. A result is inconclusive if the LLM evaluator in the second ordering flips its vote in relation to the first vote.
  * `ties`: A `PairwiseComparisonEvaluator` can also return a “tie” result. This is the number of examples for which it gave a tie result.
  * `agreement_rate_with_ties`: The rate at which the LLM evaluator agrees with the reference (in this case human) evaluator, when also including ties. The denominator used to compute this metric is given by: `number_examples - invalid_predictions - inconclusives`.
  * `agreement_rate_without_ties`: The rate at which the LLM evaluator agress with the reference (in this case human) evaluator, when excluding and ties. The denominator used to compute this metric is given by: `number_examples - invalid_predictions - inconclusives - ties`.


To compute these metrics, we’ll make use of the `EvaluatorBenchmarkerPack`.

### Gemini Pro
[Section titled “Gemini Pro”](https://developers.llamaindex.ai/python/examples/evaluation/mt_bench_human_judgement/#gemini-pro)
NOTE: The rate limit for Gemini models is still very constraining, which is understandable given that they’ve just been released at the time of writing this notebook. So, we use a very small `batch_size` and moderately high `sleep_time_in_seconds` to reduce risk of getting rate-limited.

```


evaluator_benchmarker = EvaluatorBenchmarkerPack(




evaluator=evaluators["gemini-pro"],




eval_dataset=pairwise_evaluator_dataset,




show_progress=True,



```


```


gemini_pro_benchmark_df =await evaluator_benchmarker.arun(




batch_size=5, sleep_time_in_seconds=0.5



```

gemini_pro_benchmark_df.index = ["gemini-pro"]

### Summary
[Section titled “Summary”](https://developers.llamaindex.ai/python/examples/evaluation/mt_bench_human_judgement/#summary)
For convenience, let’s put all the results in a single DataFrame.

```


import pandas as pd





final_benchmark = pd.concat(





gpt_3p5_benchmark_df,




gpt_4_benchmark_df,




gemini_pro_benchmark_df,





axis=0,




final_benchmark

```


```

.dataframe tbody tr th {



vertical-align: top;





.dataframe thead th {



text-align: right;



```
  
| number_examples  | invalid_predictions  | inconclusives  | ties  | agreement_rate_with_ties  | agreement_rate_without_ties  |  
| --- | --- | --- | --- | --- | --- |  
| gpt-3.5  | 1204  | 82  | 393  | 56  | 0.736626  | 0.793462  |  
| gpt-4  | 1204  | 0  | 100  | 103  | 0.701087  | 0.770230  |  
| gemini-pro  | 1204  | 2  | 295  | 60  | 0.742007  | 0.793388  |  
From the results above, we make the following observations:
  * In terms of agreement rates, all three models seem quite close, with perhaps a slight edge given to the Gemini models
  * Gemini Pro and GPT-3.5 seem to be a bit more assertive than GPT-4 resulting in only 50-60 ties to GPT-4’s 100 ties.
  * However, perhaps related to the previous point, GPT-4 yields the least amount of inconclusives, meaning that it suffers the least from position bias.
  * Overall, it seems that Gemini Pro is up to snuff with GPT models, and would say that it outperforms GPT-3.5 — looks like Gemini can be legit alternatives to GPT models for evaluation tasks.
