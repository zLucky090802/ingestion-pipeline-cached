```


import nest_asyncio




nest_asyncio.apply()

```


```


from llama_index.llms.lmstudio import LMStudio




from llama_index.core.base.llms.types import ChatMessage, MessageRole


```


```


llm = LMStudio(




model_name="Hermes-2-Pro-Llama-3-8B",




base_url="http://localhost:1234/v1",




temperature=0.7,



```


```


response = llm.complete("Hey there, what is 2+2?")




print(str(response))


```


```

The result of 2 + 2 is 4.

```


```

# use llm.stream_complete



response = llm.stream_complete("What is 7+3?")




forin response:




print(r.delta, end="")


```


```

The result of 7 + 3 is 10.

4. In sports: In baseball, a perfect game is considered to be an immaculate game with no hits, errors, or runners allowed to reach base; only 15 players can achieve this in Major League Baseball history, and the number of their names added together equals 42 (6 + 2 = 8, 3 + 4 = 7).
