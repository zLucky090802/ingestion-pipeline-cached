# FLARE Query Engine 
Adapted from the paper “Active Retrieval Augmented Generation”
Currently implements FLARE Instruct, which tells the LLM to generate retrieval instructions.
If you’re opening this Notebook on colab, you will probably need to install LlamaIndex 🦙.

The author's trajectory in the startup world began with their involvement in various projects and activities, such as writing essays on different topics, working on spam filters, and painting. They also hosted dinners for friends, which helped them learn how to cook for groups and network with people from various backgrounds.



In October 2003, the author met Jessica Livingston at a party, who later became a significant figure in their startup journey. Jessica worked in marketing at a Boston investment bank and was intrigued by the stories of startup founders she met through the author. She decided to compile a book of interviews with these founders.



In early 2005, Jessica interviewed for a marketing job at a Boston VC firm, which led the author to discuss the issues with venture capital and how it could be improved. The author also gave a talk at the Harvard Computer Society about starting a startup, which made them realize they should start angel investing.



On March 11, the author, Jessica, and their friends Robert and Trevor decided to start their own investment firm, implementing the ideas they had discussed. They founded Y Combinator, an angel investment firm that made unconventional choices in the startup world. The author's trajectory in the startup world has been marked by their involvement in various projects, networking, and eventually co-founding a successful investment firm.

They wrote numerous essays on various topics, which were later compiled into a book called Hackers & Painters. They also worked on spam filters and pursued painting as a hobby.

They bought a building in Cambridge, which was a former candy factory and later a porn studio, to use as an office.



In October 2003, the author met Jessica Livingston at a party, and they started dating a few days later. Jessica worked in marketing at a Boston investment bank and later decided to compile a book of interviews with startup founders. When she was looking for a new job, the author shared their thoughts on how venture capital should be improved.



The author also attended the Accademia, a prestigious institution, to study painting. However, they were disappointed with the lack of teaching and learning taking place there. The author painted still lives in their bedroom at night, using leftover scraps of canvas.
