# How to Build a Chatbot 
LlamaIndex serves as a bridge between your data and Language Learning Models (LLMs), providing a toolkit that enables you to establish a query interface around your data for a variety of tasks, such as question-answering and summarization.
In this tutorial, we’ll walk you through building a context-augmented chatbot using a [Data Agent](https://gpt-index.readthedocs.io/en/stable/core_modules/agent_modules/agents/root.html). This agent, powered by LLMs, is capable of intelligently executing tasks over your data. The end result is a chatbot agent equipped with a robust set of data interface tools provided by LlamaIndex to answer queries about your data.
**Note** : This tutorial builds upon initial work on creating a query interface over SEC 10-K filings - [check it out here](https://medium.com/@jerryjliu98/how-unstructured-and-llamaindex-can-help-bring-the-power-of-llms-to-your-own-data-3657d063e30d).
### Context
[Section titled “Context”](https://developers.llamaindex.ai/python/examples/agent/chatbot_sec/#context)
In this guide, we’ll build a “10-K Chatbot” that uses raw UBER 10-K HTML filings from Dropbox. Users can interact with the chatbot to ask questions related to the 10-K filings.
### Preparation
[Section titled “Preparation”](https://developers.llamaindex.ai/python/examples/agent/chatbot_sec/#preparation)

```


%pip install llama-index-readers-file




%pip install llama-index-embeddings-openai




%pip install llama-index-agent-openai




%pip install llama-index-llms-openai




%pip install llama-index-question-gen-openai




%pip install unstructured


```


```


import os





os.environ["OPENAI_API_KEY"] ="sk-..."


```


```


from llama_index.core import Settings




from llama_index.llms.openai import OpenAI




from llama_index.embeddings.openai import OpenAIEmbedding




# global defaults



Settings.llm = OpenAI(model="gpt-4o-mini")




Settings.embed_model = OpenAIEmbedding(model_name="text-embedding-3-large")




Settings.chunk_size =512




Settings.chunk_overlap =64


```

### Ingest Data
[Section titled “Ingest Data”](https://developers.llamaindex.ai/python/examples/agent/chatbot_sec/#ingest-data)
Let’s first download the raw 10-k files, from 2019-2022.

```


# NOTE: the code examples assume you're operating within a Jupyter notebook.



# download files



!mkdir data




!wget "https://www.dropbox.com/s/948jr9cfs7fgj99/UBER.zip?dl=1"-O data/UBER.zip




!unzip data/UBER.zip -d data


```

To parse the HTML files into formatted text, we use the [Unstructured](https://github.com/Unstructured-IO/unstructured) library. Thanks to [LlamaHub](https://llamahub.ai/), we can directly integrate with Unstructured, allowing conversion of any text into a Document format that LlamaIndex can ingest.
First we install the necessary packages:
Then we can use the `UnstructuredReader` to parse the HTML files into a list of `Document` objects.

```


from llama_index.readers.file import UnstructuredReader




from pathlib import Path





years = [2022, 2021, 2020, 2019]


```


```


loader = UnstructuredReader()




doc_set = {}




all_docs = []




for year in years:




year_docs = loader.load_data(




file=Path(f"./data/UBER/UBER_{year}.html"), split_documents=False





# insert year metadata into each year




forin year_docs:




d.metadata = {"year": year}




doc_set[year] = year_docs




all_docs.extend(year_docs)


```

### Setting up Vector Indices for each year
[Section titled “Setting up Vector Indices for each year”](https://developers.llamaindex.ai/python/examples/agent/chatbot_sec/#setting-up-vector-indices-for-each-year)
We first setup a vector index for each year. Each vector index allows us to ask questions about the 10-K filing of a given year.
We build each index and save it to disk.

```

# initialize simple vector indices



# NOTE: don't run this cell if the indices are already loaded!




from llama_index.core import VectorStoreIndex, StorageContext






index_set = {}




for year in years:




storage_context = StorageContext.from_defaults()




cur_index = VectorStoreIndex.from_documents(




doc_set[year],




storage_context=storage_context,





index_set[year] = cur_index




storage_context.persist(persist_dir=f"./storage/{year}")


```

To load an index from disk, do the following

```

# Load indices from disk



from llama_index.core import StorageContext, load_index_from_storage





index_set = {}




for year in years:




storage_context = StorageContext.from_defaults(




persist_dir=f"./storage/{year}"





cur_index = load_index_from_storage(




storage_context,





index_set[year] = cur_index


```

### Setting up a Sub Question Query Engine to Synthesize Answers Across 10-K Filings
[Section titled “Setting up a Sub Question Query Engine to Synthesize Answers Across 10-K Filings”](https://developers.llamaindex.ai/python/examples/agent/chatbot_sec/#setting-up-a-sub-question-query-engine-to-synthesize-answers-across-10-k-filings)
Since we have access to documents of 4 years, we may not only want to ask questions regarding the 10-K document of a given year, but ask questions that require analysis over all 10-K filings.
To address this, we can use a [Sub Question Query Engine](https://gpt-index.readthedocs.io/en/stable/examples/query_engine/sub_question_query_engine.html). It decomposes a query into subqueries, each answered by an individual vector index, and synthesizes the results to answer the overall query.
LlamaIndex provides some wrappers around indices (and query engines) so that they can be used by query engines and agents. First we define a `QueryEngineTool` for each vector index. Each tool has a name and a description; these are what the LLM agent sees to decide which tool to choose.

```


from llama_index.core.tools import QueryEngineTool





individual_query_engine_tools = [




QueryEngineTool.from_defaults(




query_engine=index_set[year].as_query_engine(),




name=f"vector_index_{year}",




description=(




"useful for when you want to answer queries about the"




f" {year} SEC 10-K for Uber"






for year in years



```

Now we can create the Sub Question Query Engine, which will allow us to synthesize answers across the 10-K filings. We pass in the `individual_query_engine_tools` we defined above.

```


from llama_index.core.query_engine import SubQuestionQueryEngine





query_engine = SubQuestionQueryEngine.from_defaults(




query_engine_tools=individual_query_engine_tools,



```

### Setting up the Chatbot Agent
[Section titled “Setting up the Chatbot Agent”](https://developers.llamaindex.ai/python/examples/agent/chatbot_sec/#setting-up-the-chatbot-agent)
We use a LlamaIndex Data Agent to setup the outer chatbot agent, which has access to a set of Tools. Specifically, we will use an FunctionAgent, that takes advantage of OpenAI API function calling. We want to use the separate Tools we defined previously for each index (corresponding to a given year), as well as a tool for the sub question query engine we defined above.
First we define a `QueryEngineTool` for the sub question query engine:

```


query_engine_tool = QueryEngineTool.from_defaults(




query_engine=query_engine,




name="sub_question_query_engine",




description=(




"useful for when you want to answer queries that require analyzing"




" multiple SEC 10-K documents for Uber"




```

Then, we combine the Tools we defined above into a single list of tools for the agent:

```


tools = individual_query_engine_tools + [query_engine_tool]


```

Finally, we call `FunctionAgent` to create the agent, passing in the list of tools we defined above.

```


from llama_index.core.agent.workflow import FunctionAgent




from llama_index.llms.openai import OpenAI





agent = FunctionAgent(tools=tools, llm=OpenAI(model="gpt-4o"))


```

### Testing the Agent
[Section titled “Testing the Agent”](https://developers.llamaindex.ai/python/examples/agent/chatbot_sec/#testing-the-agent)
We can now test the agent with various queries.
If we test it with a simple “hello” query, the agent does not use any Tools.

```


from llama_index.core.workflow import Context




# Setup the context for this specific interaction



ctx = Context(agent)





response =await agent.run("hi, i am bob", ctx=ctx)




print(str(response))


```


```

Hello Bob! How can I assist you today?

```

If we test it with a query regarding the 10-k of a given year, the agent will use the relevant vector index Tool.

```


response =await agent.run(




"What were some of the biggest risk factors in 2020 for Uber?", ctx=ctx





print(str(response))


```


```

In 2020, some of the biggest risk factors for Uber included:



1. **Legal and Regulatory Risks**: Extensive government regulation and oversight could adversely impact operations and future prospects.


2. **Data Privacy and Security Risks**: Risks related to data collection, use, and processing could lead to investigations, litigation, and negative publicity.


3. **Economic Impact of COVID-19**: The pandemic adversely affected business operations, demand for services, and financial condition due to governmental restrictions and changes in consumer behavior.


4. **Market Volatility**: Volatility in the market price of common stock could affect investors' ability to resell shares at favorable prices.


5. **Safety Incidents**: Criminal or dangerous activities on the platform could harm the ability to attract and retain drivers and consumers.


6. **Investment Risks**: Substantial investments in new technologies and offerings carry inherent risks, with no guarantee of realizing expected benefits.


7. **Dependence on Metropolitan Areas**: A significant portion of gross bookings comes from large metropolitan areas, which may be negatively impacted by various external factors.


8. **Talent Retention**: Attracting and retaining high-quality personnel is crucial, and issues with attrition or succession planning could adversely affect the business.


9. **Cybersecurity Threats**: Cyberattacks and data breaches could harm reputation and operational results.


10. **Capital Requirements**: The need for additional capital to support growth may not be met on reasonable terms, impacting business expansion.


11. **Acquisition Challenges**: Difficulty in identifying and integrating suitable businesses could harm operating results and future prospects.


12. **Operational Limitations**: Potential restrictions in certain jurisdictions may require modifications to the business model, affecting service delivery.

```

Finally, if we test it with a query to compare/contrast risk factors across years, the agent will use the Sub Question Query Engine Tool.

```


cross_query_str = (




"Compare/contrast the risk factors described in the Uber 10-K across"




" years. Give answer in bullet points."






response =await agent.run(cross_query_str, ctx=ctx)




print(str(response))


```


```

Here's a comparison of the risk factors for Uber across the years 2020, 2021, and 2022:



- **COVID-19 Impact**:



- **2020**: The pandemic significantly affected business operations, demand, and financial condition.

### Setting up the Chatbot Loop
[Section titled “Setting up the Chatbot Loop”](https://developers.llamaindex.ai/python/examples/agent/chatbot_sec/#setting-up-the-chatbot-loop)
Now that we have the chatbot setup, it only takes a few more steps to setup a basic interactive loop to chat with our SEC-augmented chatbot!

```


agent = FunctionAgent(tools=tools, llm=OpenAI(model="gpt-4o"))




ctx = Context(agent)





whileTrue:




text_input =input("User: ")




if text_input =="exit":




break




response =await agent.run(text_input, ctx=ctx)




print(f"Agent: {response}")




# User: What were some of the legal proceedings against Uber in 2022?
