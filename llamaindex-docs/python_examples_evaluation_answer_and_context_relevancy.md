# Answer Relevancy and Context Relevancy Evaluations 
In this notebook, we demonstrate how to utilize the `AnswerRelevancyEvaluator` and `ContextRelevancyEvaluator` classes to get a measure on the relevancy of a generated answer and retrieved contexts, respectively, to a given user query. Both of these evaluators return a `score` that is between 0 and 1 as well as a generated `feedback` explaining the score. Note that, higher score means higher relevancy. In particular, we prompt the judge LLM to take a step-by-step approach in providing a relevancy score, asking it to answer the following two questions of a generated answer to a query for answer relevancy (for context relevancy these are slightly adjusted):
  1. Does the provided response match the subject matter of the user’s query?
  2. Does the provided response attempt to address the focus or perspective on the subject matter taken on by the user’s query?


Each question is worth 1 point and so a perfect evaluation would yield a score of 2/2.

[Section titled “Download the dataset (LabelledRagDataset)”](https://developers.llamaindex.ai/python/examples/evaluation/answer_and_context_relevancy/#download-the-dataset-labelledragdataset)
For this demonstration, we will use a llama-dataset provided through our [llama-hub](https://llamahub.ai).

```

Next, we build a RAG over the same source documents used to created the `rag_dataset`.

```


index = VectorStoreIndex.from_documents(documents=documents)




query_engine = index.as_query_engine()


```

With our RAG (i.e `query_engine`) defined, we can make predictions (i.e., generate responses to the query) with it over the `rag_dataset`.

```


prediction_dataset =await rag_dataset.amake_predictions_with(




predictor=query_engine, batch_size=100, show_progress=True

### Evaluating Answer and Context Relevancy Separately
[Section titled “Evaluating Answer and Context Relevancy Separately”](https://developers.llamaindex.ai/python/examples/evaluation/answer_and_context_relevancy/#evaluating-answer-and-context-relevancy-separately)
We first need to define our evaluators (i.e. `AnswerRelevancyEvaluator` & `ContextRelevancyEvaluator`):

```

# instantiate the gpt-4 judges



from llama_index.llms.openai import OpenAI




from llama_index.core.evaluation import (




AnswerRelevancyEvaluator,




ContextRelevancyEvaluator,






judges = {}





judges["answer_relevancy"] = AnswerRelevancyEvaluator(




llm=OpenAI(temperature=0, model="gpt-3.5-turbo"),






judges["context_relevancy"] = ContextRelevancyEvaluator(




llm=OpenAI(temperature=0, model="gpt-4"),



```

Now, we can use our evaluator to make evaluations by looping through all of the <example, prediction> pairs.

```


eval_tasks = []




for example, prediction inzip(




rag_dataset.examples, prediction_dataset.predictions





eval_tasks.append(




judges["answer_relevancy"].aevaluate(




query=example.query,




response=prediction.response,




sleep_time_in_seconds=1.0,






eval_tasks.append(




judges["context_relevancy"].aevaluate(




query=example.query,




contexts=prediction.contexts,




sleep_time_in_seconds=1.0,




```


```


eval_results1 =await tqdm_asyncio.gather(*eval_tasks[:250])


```


```

100%|█████████████████████████████████████████████████████| 250/250 [00:28<00:00,  8.85it/s]

```


```


eval_results2 =await tqdm_asyncio.gather(*eval_tasks[250:])


```


```

100%|█████████████████████████████████████████████████████| 302/302 [00:31<00:00,  9.62it/s]

```


```


eval_results = eval_results1 + eval_results2


```


```


evals = {




"answer_relevancy": eval_results[::2],




"context_relevancy": eval_results[1::2],



```

### Taking a look at the evaluation results
[Section titled “Taking a look at the evaluation results”](https://developers.llamaindex.ai/python/examples/evaluation/answer_and_context_relevancy/#taking-a-look-at-the-evaluation-results)
Here we use a utility function to convert the list of `EvaluationResult` objects into something more notebook friendly. This utility will provide two DataFrames, one deep one containing all of the evaluation results, and another one which aggregates via taking the mean of all the scores, per evaluation method.

```


from llama_index.core.evaluation.notebook_utils import get_eval_results_df




import pandas as pd





deep_dfs = {}




mean_dfs = {}




for metric in evals.keys():




deep_df, mean_df = get_eval_results_df(




names=["baseline"] *len(evals[metric]),




results_arr=evals[metric],




metric=metric,





deep_dfs[metric] = deep_df




mean_dfs[metric] = mean_df


```


```


mean_scores_df = pd.concat(




[mdf.reset_index() for _, mdf in mean_dfs.items()],




axis=0,




ignore_index=True,





mean_scores_df = mean_scores_df.set_index("index")




mean_scores_df.index = mean_scores_df.index.set_names(["metrics"])



mean_scores_df

```


```

.dataframe tbody tr th {



vertical-align: top;





.dataframe thead th {



text-align: right;



```
  
| rag  | baseline  |  
| --- | --- |  
| metrics  |  
| mean_answer_relevancy_score  | 0.914855  |  
| mean_context_relevancy_score  | 0.572273  |  
The above utility also provides the mean score across all of the evaluations in `mean_df`.
We can get a look at the raw distribution of the scores by invoking `value_counts()` on the `deep_df`.

```


deep_dfs["answer_relevancy"]["scores"].value_counts()


```


```

scores


1.0    250


0.0     21


0.5      5


Name: count, dtype: int64

```


```


deep_dfs["context_relevancy"]["scores"].value_counts()


```


```

scores


1.000    89


0.000    70


0.750    49


0.250    23


0.625    14


0.500    11


0.375    10


0.875     9


Name: count, dtype: int64

```

It looks like for the most part, the default RAG does fairly well in terms of generating answers that are relevant to the query. Getting a closer look is made possible by viewing the records of any of the `deep_df`’s.

```


displayify_df(deep_dfs["context_relevancy"].head(2))

They have attracted significant attention\nand been deployed in numerous downstream applications. Nevertheless, akin\nto a double-edged sword, LLMs also present potential risks. They could\nsuffer from private data leaks or yield inappropriate, harmful, or misleading\ncontent. Additionally, the rapid progress of LLMs raises concerns about the\npotential emergence of superintelligent systems without adequate safeguards.\nTo effectively capitalize on LLM capacities as well as ensure their safe and\nbeneficial development, it is critical to conduct a rigorous and comprehensive\nevaluation of LLMs.\nThis survey endeavors to offer a panoramic perspective on the evaluation\nof LLMs. We categorize the evaluation of LLMs into three major groups:\nknowledgeandcapabilityevaluation, alignmentevaluationandsafetyevaluation.\nIn addition to the comprehensive review on the evaluation methodologies and\nbenchmarks on these three aspects, we collate a compendium of evaluations\npertaining to LLMs’ performance in specialized domains, and discuss the\nconstruction of comprehensive evaluation platforms that cover LLM evaluations\non capabilities, alignment, safety, and applicability.\nWe hope that this comprehensive overview will stimulate further research\ninterests in the evaluation of LLMs, with the ultimate goal of making evaluation\nserve as a cornerstone in guiding the responsible development of LLMs. We\nenvision that this will channel their evolution into a direction that maximizes\nsocietal benefit while minimizing potential risks. A curated list of related\npapers has been publicly available at a GitHub repository.1\n∗Equal contribution\n†Corresponding author.\n1https://github.com/tjunlp-lab/Awesome-LLMs-Evaluation-Papers\n1arXiv:2310.19736v3 [cs.CL] 25 Nov 2023', 'criteria. Multilingual Holistic Bias (Costa-jussà et al., 2023) extends the HolisticBias dataset\nto 50 languages, achieving the largest scale of English template-based text expansion.\nWhether using automatic or manual evaluations, both approaches inevitably carry human\nsubjectivity and cannot establish a comprehensive and fair evaluation standard. Unqover\n(Li et al., 2020) is the first to transform the task of evaluating biases generated by models\ninto a multiple-choice question, covering gender, nationality, race, and religion categories.\nThey provide models with ambiguous and disambiguous contexts and ask them to choose\nbetween options with and without stereotypes, evaluating both PLMs and models fine-tuned\non multiple-choice question answering datasets. BBQ (Parrish et al., 2022) adopts this\napproach but extends the types of biases to nine categories. All sentence templates are\nmanually created, and in addition to the two contrasting group answers, the model is also\nprovided with correct answers like “I don’t know” and “I’m not sure”, and a statistical bias\nscore metric is proposed to evaluate multiple question answering models. CBBQ (Huang\n& Xiong, 2023) extends BBQ to Chinese. Based on Chinese socio-cultural factors, CBBQ\nadds four categories: disease, educational qualification, household registration, and region.\nThey manually rewrite ambiguous text templates and use GPT-4 to generate disambiguous\ntemplates, greatly increasing the dataset’s diversity and extensibility. Additionally, they\nimprove the experimental setup for LLMs and evaluate existing Chinese open-source LLMs,\nfinding that current Chinese LLMs not only have higher bias scores but also exhibit behavioral\ninconsistencies, revealing a significant gap compared to GPT-3.5-Turbo.\nIn addition to these aforementioned evaluation methods, we could also use advanced LLMs for\nscoring bias, such as GPT-4, or employ models that perform best in training bias detection\ntasks to detect the level of bias in answers. Such models can be used not only in the evaluation\nphase but also for identifying biases in data for pre-training LLMs, facilitating debiasing in\ntraining data.\nAs the development of multilingual LLMs and domain-specific LLMs progresses, studies on\nthe fairness of these models become increasingly important. Zhao et al. (2020) create datasets\nto study gender bias in multilingual embeddings and cross-lingual tasks, revealing gender\nbias from both internal and external perspectives. Moreover, FairLex (Chalkidis et al., 2022)\nproposes a multilingual legal dataset as fairness benchmark, covering four judicial jurisdictions\n(European Commission, United States, Swiss Federation, and People’s Republic of China), five\nlanguages (English, German, French, Italian, and Chinese), and various sensitive attributes\n(gender, age, region, etc.). As LLMs have been applied and deployed in the finance and legal\nsectors, these studies deserve high attention.\n4.3 Toxicity\nLLMs are usually trained on a huge amount of online data which may contain toxic behavior\nand unsafe content. These include hate speech, offensive/abusive language, pornographic\ncontent, etc. It is hence very desirable to evaluate how well trained LLMs deal with toxicity.\nConsidering the proficiency of LLMs in understanding and generating sentences, we categorize\nthe evaluation of toxicity into two tasks: toxicity identification and classification evaluation,\nand the evaluation of toxicity in generated sentences.\n29']  | 1.000000  | 1.

Question-answering and knowledge completion\ntasks stand as quintessential assessments for gauging the practical application of knowledge,\nwhile the various reasoning tasks serve as a litmus test for probing the meta-reasoning and\nintricate reasoning competencies of LLMs. Furthermore, the recently emphasized special\nability of tool learning is spotlighted, showcasing its significance in empowering models to\nadeptly handle and generate domain-specific content.\nSection 4, designated as “Alignment Evaluation”, hones in on the scrutiny of LLMs’ perfor-\nmance across critical dimensions, encompassing ethical considerations, moral implications,\nbias detection, toxicity assessment, and truthfulness evaluation. The pivotal aim here is to\nscrutinize and mitigate the potential risks that may emerge in the realms of ethics, bias,\nand toxicity, as LLMs can inadvertently generate discriminatory, biased, or offensive content.\nFurthermore, this section acknowledges the phenomenon of hallucinations within LLMs, which\ncan lead to the inadvertent dissemination of false information. As such, an indispensable\nfacet of this evaluation involves the rigorous assessment of truthfulness, underscoring its\nsignificance as an essential aspect to evaluate and rectify.\nSection 5, titled “Safety Evaluation”, embarks on a comprehensive exploration of two funda-\nmental dimensions: the robustness of LLMs and their evaluation in the context of Artificial\nGeneral Intelligence (AGI). LLMs are routinely deployed in real-world scenarios, where their\nrobustness becomes paramount.

The distinctions between our survey and these two related\nworks further highlight the novel contributions of our study to the literature.\n2 Taxonomy and Roadmap\nThe primary objective of this survey is to meticulously categorize the evaluation of LLMs,\nfurnishing readers with a well-structured taxonomy framework. Through this framework,\nreaders can gain a nuanced understanding of LLMs’ performance and the attendant challenges\nacross diverse and pivotal domains.\nNumerous studies posit that the bedrock of LLMs’ capabilities resides in knowledge and\nreasoning, serving as the underpinning for their exceptional performance across a myriad of\ntasks. Nonetheless, the effective application of these capabilities necessitates a meticulous\nexamination of alignment concerns to ensure that the model’s outputs remain consistent with\nuser expectations. Moreover, the vulnerability of LLMs to malicious exploits or inadvertent\nmisuse underscores the imperative nature of safety considerations.

Question-answering and knowledge completion\ntasks stand as quintessential assessments for gauging the practical application of knowledge,\nwhile the various reasoning tasks serve as a litmus test for probing the meta-reasoning and\nintricate reasoning competencies of LLMs. Furthermore, the recently emphasized special\nability of tool learning is spotlighted, showcasing its significance in empowering models to\nadeptly handle and generate domain-specific content.\nSection 4, designated as “Alignment Evaluation”, hones in on the scrutiny of LLMs’ perfor-\nmance across critical dimensions, encompassing ethical considerations, moral implications,\nbias detection, toxicity assessment, and truthfulness evaluation. The pivotal aim here is to\nscrutinize and mitigate the potential risks that may emerge in the realms of ethics, bias,\nand toxicity, as LLMs can inadvertently generate discriminatory, biased, or offensive content.\nFurthermore, this section acknowledges the phenomenon of hallucinations within LLMs, which\ncan lead to the inadvertent dissemination of false information. As such, an indispensable\nfacet of this evaluation involves the rigorous assessment of truthfulness, underscoring its\nsignificance as an essential aspect to evaluate and rectify.\nSection 5, titled “Safety Evaluation”, embarks on a comprehensive exploration of two funda-\nmental dimensions: the robustness of LLMs and their evaluation in the context of Artificial\nGeneral Intelligence (AGI). LLMs are routinely deployed in real-world scenarios, where their\nrobustness becomes paramount. Robustness equips them to navigate disturbances stemming\nfrom users and the environment, while also shielding against malicious attacks and deception,\nthereby ensuring consistent high-level performance.

In essence, our aim is to address the following\nfundamental questions:\n•What are the capabilities of LLMs?\n•What factors must be taken into account when deploying LLMs?\n•In which domains can LLMs find practical applications?\n•How do LLMs perform in these diverse domains?\nWe will now embark on an in-depth exploration of each category within the LLM evaluation\ntaxonomy, sequentially addressing capabilities, concerns, applications, and performance.\n3 Knowledge and Capability Evaluation\nEvaluating the knowledge and capability of LLMs has become an important research area as\nthese models grow in scale and capability. As LLMs are deployed in more applications, it is\ncrucial to rigorously assess their strengths and limitations across a diverse range of tasks and\ndatasets. In this section, we aim to offer a comprehensive overview of the evaluation methods\nand benchmarks pertinent to LLMs, spanning various capabilities such as question answering,\nknowledge completion, reasoning, and tool use. Our objective is to provide an exhaustive\nsynthesis of the current advancements in the systematic evaluation and benchmarking of\nLLMs’ knowledge and capabilities, as illustrated in Figure 2.\n3.1 Question Answering\nQuestionansweringisaveryimportantmeansforLLMsevaluation, andthequestionanswering\nability of LLMs directly determines whether the final output can meet the expectation. At\nthe same time, however, since any form of LLMs evaluation can be regarded as question\nanswering or transfer to question answering form, there are rare datasets and works that\npurely evaluate question answering ability of LLMs. Most of the datasets are curated to\nevaluate other capabilities of LLMs.\nTherefore, we believe that the datasets simply used to evaluate the question answering ability\nof LLMs must be from a wide range of sources, preferably covering all fields rather than\naiming at some fields, and the questions do not need to be very professional but general.\nAccording to the above criteria for datasets focusing on question answering capability, we can\nfind that many datasets are qualified, e.g., SQuAD (Rajpurkar et al., 2016), NarrativeQA\n(Kociský et al., 2018), HotpotQA (Yang et al., 2018), CoQA (Reddy et al., 2019).
