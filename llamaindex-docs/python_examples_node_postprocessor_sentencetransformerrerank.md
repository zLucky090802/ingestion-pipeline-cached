from llama_index.core.postprocessor import SentenceTransformerRerank





rerank = SentenceTransformerRerank(

First, we try with reranking. We time the query to see how long it takes to process the output from the retrieved context.

```


from time import time


```


```


query_engine = index.as_query_engine(




similarity_top_k=10, node_postprocessors=[rerank]






now = time()




response = query_engine.query(




"Which grad schools did the author apply for and why?",





print(f"Elapsed: {round(time() - now, 2)}s")


```


```

Elapsed: 4.03s

```


```


print(response)


```


```

The author applied to three grad schools: MIT and Yale, which were renowned for AI at the time, and Harvard, which the author had visited because a friend went there and it was also home to Bill Woods, who had invented the type of parser the author used in his SHRDLU clone. The author chose these schools because he wanted to learn about AI and Lisp, and these schools were known for their expertise in these areas.

Next, we try without rerank

```


query_engine = index.as_query_engine(similarity_top_k=10)






now = time()




response = query_engine.query(




"Which grad schools did the author apply for and why?",






print(f"Elapsed: {round(time() - now, 2)}s")

```

Elapsed: 28.13s

print(response)

```

The author applied to three grad schools: MIT and Yale, which were renowned for AI at the time, and Harvard, which the author had visited because a friend went there and was also home to Bill Woods, who had invented the type of parser the author used in his SHRDLU clone. The author chose these schools because he was interested in Artificial Intelligence and wanted to pursue it further, and they were the most renowned for it at the time. He was also inspired by a novel by Heinlein called The Moon is a Harsh Mistress, which featured an intelligent computer called Mike, and a PBS documentary that showed Terry Winograd using SHRDLU. Additionally, the author had dropped out of RISD, where he had been learning to paint, and was looking for a new challenge. He was drawn to the idea of pursuing AI, as it was a field that was rapidly growing and he wanted to be part of the cutting edge of technology. He was also inspired by the idea of creating something unique and innovative, as he had done with his SHRDLU clone, and wanted to continue to explore the possibilities of AI.

```

As we can see, the query engine with reranking produced a much more concise output in much lower time (4s v.s. 28s). While both responses were essentially correct, the query engine without reranking included a lot of irrelevant information - a phenomenon we could attribute to “pollution of the context window”.
