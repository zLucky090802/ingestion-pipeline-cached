# LongContextReorder 
Models struggle to access significant details found in the center of extended contexts. [A study](https://arxiv.org/abs/2307.03172) observed that the best performance typically arises when crucial data is positioned at the start or conclusion of the input context. Additionally, as the input context lengthens, performance drops notably, even in models designed for long contexts.
This module will re-order the retrieved nodes, which can be helpful in cases where a large top-k is needed. The reordering process works as follows:
  1. Input nodes are sorted based on their relevance scores.
  2. Sorted nodes are then reordered in an alternating pattern: 
     * Even-indexed nodes are placed at the beginning of the new list.
     * Odd-indexed nodes are placed at the end of the new list.


This approach ensures that the highest-scored (most relevant) nodes are positioned at the beginning and end of the list, with lower-scored nodes in the middle.
## Setup
[Section titled “Setup”](https://developers.llamaindex.ai/python/examples/node_postprocessor/longcontextreorder/#setup)
If you’re opening this Notebook on colab, you will probably need to install LlamaIndex 🦙.

```


%pip install llama-index-embeddings-huggingface




%pip install llama-index-llms-openai


```


```


!pip install llama-index


```


```


import os




import openai





os.environ["OPENAI_API_KEY"] ="sk-..."


```


```


from llama_index.embeddings.huggingface import HuggingFaceEmbedding




from llama_index.llms.openai import OpenAI




from llama_index.core import Settings





Settings.llm = OpenAI(model="gpt-3.5-turbo-instruct", temperature=0.1)




Settings.embed_model = HuggingFaceEmbedding(model_name="BAAI/bge-base-en-v1.5")


```


```

/home/loganm/miniconda3/envs/llama-index/lib/python3.11/site-packages/torch/cuda/__init__.py:546: UserWarning: Can't initialize NVML



warnings.warn("Can't initialize NVML")


```

Download Data

```


!mkdir -p 'data/paul_graham/'




!wget 'https://raw.githubusercontent.com/run-llama/llama_index/main/docs/examples/data/paul_graham/paul_graham_essay.txt'-O 'data/paul_graham/paul_graham_essay.txt'


```


```


from llama_index.core import SimpleDirectoryReader





documents = SimpleDirectoryReader("./data/paul_graham/").load_data()


```


```


from llama_index.core import VectorStoreIndex





index = VectorStoreIndex.from_documents(documents)


```

## Run Query
[Section titled “Run Query”](https://developers.llamaindex.ai/python/examples/node_postprocessor/longcontextreorder/#run-query)

```


from llama_index.core.postprocessor import LongContextReorder





reorder = LongContextReorder()





reorder_engine = index.as_query_engine(




node_postprocessors=[reorder], similarity_top_k=5





base_engine = index.as_query_engine(similarity_top_k=5)


```


```


from llama_index.core.response.notebook_utils import display_response





base_response = base_engine.query("Did the author meet Sam Altman?")



display_response(base_response)

```

**`Final Response:`**Yes, the author met Sam Altman when they asked him to be the president of Y Combinator. This was during the time when the author was in a PhD program in computer science and also pursuing their passion for art. They were applying to art schools and eventually ended up attending RISD.

```


reorder_response = reorder_engine.query("Did the author meet Sam Altman?")



display_response(reorder_response)

```

**`Final Response:`**Yes, the author met Sam Altman when they asked him to be the president of Y Combinator. This meeting occurred at a party at the author’s house, where they were introduced by a mutual friend, Jessica Livingston. Jessica later went on to compile a book of interviews with startup founders, and the author shared their thoughts on the flaws of venture capital with her during her job search at a Boston VC firm.
