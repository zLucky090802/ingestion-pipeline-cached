# Recursive Retriever + Query Engine Demo 
In this demo, we walk through a use case of showcasing our “RecursiveRetriever” module over hierarchical data.
The concept of recursive retrieval is that we not only explore the directly most relevant nodes, but also explore node relationships to additional retrievers/query engines and execute them. For instance, a node may represent a concise summary of a structured table, and link to a SQL/Pandas query engine over that structured table. Then if the node is retrieved, we want to also query the underlying query engine for the answer.
This can be especially useful for documents with hierarchical relationships. In this example, we walk through a Wikipedia article about billionaires (in PDF form), which contains both text and a variety of embedded structured tables. We first create a Pandas query engine over each table, but also represent each table by an `IndexNode` (stores a link to the query engine); this Node is stored along with other Nodes in a vector store.
During query-time, if an `IndexNode` is fetched, then the underlying query engine/retriever will be queried.
**Notes about Setup**
We use `camelot` to extract text-based tables from PDFs.

```


%pip install llama-index-embeddings-openai




%pip install llama-index-readers-file pymupdf




%pip install llama-index-llms-openai




%pip install llama-index-experimental


```

## Load in Document (and Tables)
[Section titled “Load in Document (and Tables)”](https://developers.llamaindex.ai/python/examples/query_engine/pdf_tables/recursive_retriever/#load-in-document-and-tables)
We use our `PyMuPDFReader` to read in the main text of the document.
We also use `camelot` to extract some structured tables from the document

```


file_path ="billionaires_page.pdf"


```


```

# initialize PDF reader



reader = PyMuPDFReader()


```


```


docs = reader.load(file_path)


```


```

# use camelot to parse tables



defget_tables(path: str, pages: List[int]):




table_dfs = []




for page in pages:




table_list = camelot.read_pdf(path, pages=str(page))




table_df = table_list[0].df




table_df = (




table_df.rename(columns=table_df.iloc[0])




.drop(table_df.index[0])




.reset_index(drop=True)





table_dfs.append(table_df)




return table_dfs


```


```


table_dfs = get_tables(file_path, pages=[3, 25])


```


```

## Create Pandas Query Engines
[Section titled “Create Pandas Query Engines”](https://developers.llamaindex.ai/python/examples/query_engine/pdf_tables/recursive_retriever/#create-pandas-query-engines)
We create a pandas query engine over each structured table.
These can be executed on their own to answer queries about each table.
**WARNING:** This tool provides the LLM access to the `eval` function. Arbitrary code execution is possible on the machine running this tool. While some level of filtering is done on code, this tool is not recommended to be used in a production setting without heavy sandboxing or virtual machines.

```

# define query engines over these tables



llm = OpenAI(model="gpt-4")





df_query_engines = [




PandasQueryEngine(table_df, llm=llm) for table_df in table_dfs



```


```


response = df_query_engines[0].query(




"What's the net worth of the second richest billionaire in 2023?"





print(str(response))


```


```

$180 billion

```


```


response = df_query_engines[1].query(




"How many billionaires were there in 2009?"





print(str(response))


```

## Build Vector Index
[Section titled “Build Vector Index”](https://developers.llamaindex.ai/python/examples/query_engine/pdf_tables/recursive_retriever/#build-vector-index)
Build vector index over the chunked document as well as over the additional `IndexNode` objects linked to the tables.

```


from llama_index.core import Settings





doc_nodes = Settings.node_parser.get_nodes_from_documents(docs)


```


```

# define index nodes



summaries = [





"This node provides information about the world's richest billionaires"




" in 2023"






"This node provides information on the number of billionaires and"




" their combined net worth from 2000 to 2023."







df_nodes = [




IndexNode(text=summary, index_id=f"pandas{idx}")




for idx, summary inenumerate(summaries)






df_id_query_engine_mapping = {




f"pandas{idx}": df_query_engine




for idx, df_query_engine inenumerate(df_query_engines)



```


```

# construct top-level vector index + query engine



vector_index = VectorStoreIndex(doc_nodes + df_nodes)




vector_retriever = vector_index.as_retriever(similarity_top_k=1)


```

## Use `RecursiveRetriever` in our `RetrieverQueryEngine`
[Section titled “Use RecursiveRetriever in our RetrieverQueryEngine”](https://developers.llamaindex.ai/python/examples/query_engine/pdf_tables/recursive_retriever/#use-recursiveretriever-in-our-retrieverqueryengine)
We define a `RecursiveRetriever` object to recursively retrieve/query nodes. We then put this in our `RetrieverQueryEngine` along with a `ResponseSynthesizer` to synthesize a response.
We pass in mappings from id to retriever and id to query engine. We then pass in a root id representing the retriever we query first.

```

# baseline vector index (that doesn't include the extra df nodes).


# used to benchmark



vector_index0 = VectorStoreIndex(doc_nodes)




vector_query_engine0 = vector_index0.as_query_engine()


```


```


from llama_index.core.retrievers import RecursiveRetriever




from llama_index.core.query_engine import RetrieverQueryEngine




from llama_index.core import get_response_synthesizer





recursive_retriever = RecursiveRetriever(




"vector",




retriever_dict={"vector": vector_retriever},




query_engine_dict=df_id_query_engine_mapping,




verbose=True,






response_synthesizer = get_response_synthesizer(response_mode="compact")





query_engine = RetrieverQueryEngine.from_args(




recursive_retriever, response_synthesizer=response_synthesizer



```


```


response = query_engine.query(




"What's the net worth of the second richest billionaire in 2023?"



```


```

```


str(response)

response = query_engine.query("How many billionaires were there in 2009?")

Based on the context information, it is not possible to determine the exact number of billionaires in 2009. The provided information only mentions the number of billionaires in 2013 and 2014.

```

response = query_engine.query(




"Which billionaires are excluded from this list?"



```


```


print(str(response))


```


```

Royal families and dictators whose wealth is contingent on a position are excluded from this list.
