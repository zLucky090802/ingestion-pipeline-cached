# NVIDIA Triton 
[NVIDIA Triton Inference Server](https://github.com/triton-inference-server/server) provides a cloud and edge inferencing solution optimized for both CPUs and GPUs. This connector allows LlamaIndex to remotely interact with TensorRT-LLM models deployed with Triton.
## Launch Triton Inference Server
[Section titled “Launch Triton Inference Server”](https://developers.llamaindex.ai/python/framework/integrations/llm/nvidia_triton/#launch-triton-inference-server)
This connector requires a running instance of Triton Inference Server with A TensorRT-LLM model. For this example, we will use a [Triton Command Line Interface (Triton CLI)](https://github.com/triton-inference-server/triton_cli) to deploy a GPT2 model on Triton.
When using Triton and related tools on your host (outside of a Triton container image) there are a number of additional dependencies that may be required for various workflows. Most system dependency issues can be resolved by installing and running the CLI from within the latest corresponding `tritonserver` container image, which should have all necessary system dependencies installed.
For TRT-LLM, you can use `nvcr.io/nvidia/tritonserver:{YY.MM}-trtllm-python-py3` image, where `YY.MM` corresponds to the version of `tritonserver`, for example in this example we’re using 24.02 version of the container. To get the list of available versions, please refer to [Triton Inference Server NGC](https://catalog.ngc.nvidia.com/orgs/nvidia/containers/tritonserver).
To start the container, run in your Linux terminal:

```

docker run -ti --gpus all --network=host --shm-size=1g --ulimit memlock=-1 nvcr.io/nvidia/tritonserver:24.02-trtllm-python-py3

```

Next, we’ll need to install dependencies with the following:

```

pip install \



"psutil" \




"pynvml>=11.5.0" \




"torch==2.1.2" \




"tensorrt_llm==0.8.0" --extra-index-url https://pypi.nvidia.com/


```

Finally, run the following to install Triton CLI.

```

pip install git+https://github.com/triton-inference-server/triton_cli.git

```

To generate the model repository for a GPT2 model and start an instance of Triton Server, run the following commands:

```

triton remove -m all


triton import -m gpt2 --backend tensorrtllm


triton start &

```

By default, Triton listens on `localhost:8000` (HTTP) and `localhost:8001` (gRPC). This example uses the gRPC port.
For more information, refer to the [Triton CLI GitHub repository](https://github.com/triton-inference-server/triton_cli).
## Install tritonclient
[Section titled “Install tritonclient”](https://developers.llamaindex.ai/python/framework/integrations/llm/nvidia_triton/#install-tritonclient)
Since we are interacting with Triton Inference Server, you need to [install](https://github.com/triton-inference-server/client?tab=readme-ov-file#download-using-python-package-installer-pip) the `tritonclient` package.

```

pip install tritonclient[all]

```

Next, we’ll install llama index connector.

```

pip install llama-index-llms-nvidia-triton

```

## Basic Usage
[Section titled “Basic Usage”](https://developers.llamaindex.ai/python/framework/integrations/llm/nvidia_triton/#basic-usage)
#### Call `complete` with a prompt
[Section titled “Call complete with a prompt”](https://developers.llamaindex.ai/python/framework/integrations/llm/nvidia_triton/#call-complete-with-a-prompt)

```


from llama_index.llms.nvidia_triton import NvidiaTriton




# A Triton server instance must be running. Use the correct URL for your desired Triton server instance.



triton_url ="localhost:8001"




model_name ="gpt2"




resp = NvidiaTriton(server_url=triton_url, model_name=model_name, tokens=32).complete("The tallest mountain in North America is ")




print(resp)


```

You should expect the following response

```

the Great Pyramid of Giza, which is about 1,000 feet high. The Great Pyramid of Giza is the tallest mountain in North America.

```

#### Call `stream_complete` with a prompt
[Section titled “Call stream_complete with a prompt”](https://developers.llamaindex.ai/python/framework/integrations/llm/nvidia_triton/#call-stream_complete-with-a-prompt)

```


resp = NvidiaTriton(server_url=triton_url, model_name=model_name, tokens=32).stream_complete("The tallest mountain in North America is ")




for delta in resp:




print(delta.delta, end=" ")


```

You should expect the following response as a stream

```

the Great Pyramid of Giza, which is about 1,000 feet high. The Great Pyramid of Giza is the tallest mountain in North America.

```
