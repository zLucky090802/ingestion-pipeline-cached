# Knowledge Distillation For Fine-Tuning A GPT-3.5 Judge (Pairwise) 
There has been recent research that demonstrated GPT-4’s ability to closely align to human judges when evaluating LLM generated texts (e.g., see [[1]](https://arxiv.org/abs/2306.05685), [[2]](https://arxiv.org/abs/2303.16634)). In this notebook, we demonstrate how to use the `llama_index` library to distill knowledge from GPT-4 to GPT-3.5 so that a smaller GPT-3.5 becomes closer to GPT-4 performance; and by proxy, closer to human judges.
To do so, we will perform the following high level steps:
  1. Generate datasets: `train_dataset` and `test_dataset`
  2. Perform knowledge distillation (using `train_dataset`)
  3. Evaluate the distilled model on `test_dataset`

For our dataset on which we will generate questions and prompt various LLMs to answer, we’re going to use the `WikipediaReader` to read “History of ” for several cities. We’re going to split up our cities into two lists: one to be used for `train_dataset` and the other for `test_dataset`.

```

### Use a `DatasetGenerator` to build `train_dataset` and `test_dataset`
[Section titled “Use a DatasetGenerator to build train_dataset and test_dataset”](https://developers.llamaindex.ai/python/examples/finetuning/llm_judge/pairwise/finetune_llm_judge/#use-a-datasetgenerator-to-build-train_dataset-and-test_dataset)
Now that we have our train and test set of `Document`’s, the next step is to generate the questions. For this we will use the `DatasetGenerator`, which uses an LLM to generate questions from given set of documents.
#### Generate Questions
[Section titled “Generate Questions”](https://developers.llamaindex.ai/python/examples/finetuning/llm_judge/pairwise/finetune_llm_judge/#generate-questions)

```


QUESTION_GEN_PROMPT= (




"You are a Teacher/ Professor. Your task is to setup "




"a quiz/examination. Using the provided context, formulate "




"a single question that captures an important fact from the "




"context. Restrict the question to the context information provided."



```

With all that out of the way, let’s spring into action. First, we will download the reference pdf document and create the set of questions against it.

```

# generate questions against chunks



from llama_index.core.evaluation import DatasetGenerator




from llama_index.llms.openai import OpenAI





llm = OpenAI(model="gpt-3.5-turbo", temperature=0.3)





# instantiate DatasetGenerator's for train and test



train_dataset_generator = DatasetGenerator.from_documents(




train_documents,




question_gen_query=QUESTION_GEN_PROMPT,




llm=llm,




show_progress=True,




num_questions_per_chunk=25,






test_dataset_generator = DatasetGenerator.from_documents(




test_documents,




question_gen_query=QUESTION_GEN_PROMPT,




llm=llm,




show_progress=True,




num_questions_per_chunk=25,



```


```

# use DatasetGenerator to create questions from nodes



train_questions = train_dataset_generator.generate_questions_from_nodes(




num=200



```

len(train_questions), len(test_questions)


```


```

```


```

# let's take a look at a few of these



train_questions[:3]


```


```

['What event in 1906 caused significant damage to San Francisco but was followed by a quick rebuild?',



'What was the name of the first significant homestead established outside the immediate vicinity of Mission Dolores in San Francisco?',




"What event in 1855 led to the establishment of San Francisco's first county hospital and the development of California's system of county hospitals for the poor?"]


```


```


test_questions[:3]


```


```

['Question: What was the name of the oldest Buddhist temple in Tokyo, founded in 628?',



'What event marked the end of the samurai system and feudal class divisions in Tokyo?',




'Question: What role did the Tokyo Imperial University play in the Meiji Era?']


```

#### Generate Answers To The Questions
[Section titled “Generate Answers To The Questions”](https://developers.llamaindex.ai/python/examples/finetuning/llm_judge/pairwise/finetune_llm_judge/#generate-answers-to-the-questions)
The next step is to generate answers using LLMs. Just a reminder, that the point is to judge these generated answers. So later on, we will use GPT models to judge these answers.
But for the generation of the answers to the questions, we will use two other LLMs, namely: Llama-2 and Mistral. In order to do this, we first a create a vector store for our documents and an associated retriever, which both of the LLM answer-generators will use.

```


from llama_index.core import VectorStoreIndex




from llama_index.core.retrievers import VectorIndexRetriever




# Create vector index



train_index = VectorStoreIndex.from_documents(documents=train_documents)




# Create the retriver on this index



train_retriever = VectorIndexRetriever(




index=train_index,




similarity_top_k=2,





# Create vector index for test to be used later



test_index = VectorStoreIndex.from_documents(documents=test_documents)




# Create the retriver for test to be used later



test_retriever = VectorIndexRetriever(




index=test_index,




similarity_top_k=2,



```

From here we will build `RetrieverQueryEngine`’s that will take in our queries (i.e. questions) for processing. Note that we use `HuggingFaceInferenceAPI` for our LLM answer-generators, and that Llama-2 requires permissions. If you haven’t yet gain accessed to these models, then feel free to swap out Llama-2 with another model of your choosing.

```


from llama_index.core.query_engine import RetrieverQueryEngine




from llama_index.llms.huggingface_api import HuggingFaceInferenceAPI






defcreate_query_engine(




hf_name: str, retriever: VectorIndexRetriever, hf_llm_generators: dict



) -> RetrieverQueryEngine:



"""Create a RetrieverQueryEngine using the HuggingFaceInferenceAPI LLM"""




if hf_name notin hf_llm_generators:




raiseKeyError("model not listed in hf_llm_generators")




llm = HuggingFaceInferenceAPI(




model_name=hf_llm_generators[hf_name],




context_window=2048# to use refine




token=HUGGING_FACE_TOKEN,





return RetrieverQueryEngine.from_args(retriever=retriever, llm=llm)


```


```

# define our llm-generators (query_engines)



hf_llm_generators = {




"mistral-7b-instruct": "mistralai/Mistral-7B-Instruct-v0.1",




"llama2-7b-chat": "meta-llama/Llama-2-7b-chat-hf",






train_query_engines = {




mdl: create_query_engine(mdl, train_retriever, hf_llm_generators)




for mdl in hf_llm_generators.keys()






test_query_engines = {




mdl: create_query_engine(mdl, test_retriever, hf_llm_generators)




for mdl in hf_llm_generators.keys()



```

We’re ready to now to produce the answers from the various LLMs. We’ll do this now for the `train_dataset` and hold off on doing this for `test_dataset` until the time comes for us to use it.
NOTE: this will take some time to generate. If you’d rather not wait, you have the option of loading the `train_qa.jsonl` that contains Llama-2 and Mistral answers per question.

```


import tqdm




import random





train_dataset = []




forin tqdm.tqdm(train_questions):




# randomly select two LLMs to generate answers to this q




model_versus = random.sample(list(train_query_engines.items()), 2)





# data for this q




data_entry = {"question": q}




responses = []




source =None





# generate answers




for name, engine in model_versus:




response = engine.query(q)




response_struct = {}




response_struct["model"] = name




response_struct["text"] =str(response)




if source isnotNone:




assert source == response.source_nodes[0].node.text[:1000] +"..."




else:




source = response.source_nodes[0].node.text[:1000] +"..."




responses.append(response_struct)





data_entry["answers"] = responses




data_entry["source"] = source




train_dataset.append(data_entry)


```

### Get GPT-4 Evaluations On The Mistral and LLama-2 Answers
[Section titled “Get GPT-4 Evaluations On The Mistral and LLama-2 Answers”](https://developers.llamaindex.ai/python/examples/finetuning/llm_judge/pairwise/finetune_llm_judge/#get-gpt-4-evaluations-on-the-mistral-and-llama-2-answers)
As mentioned a couple of times before, the point of this guide is fine-tune an LLM judge from a GPT-4 judge. So, in order to complete our `train_dataset` we now need to instantiate our GPT-4 judge and have it evaluate the answers that were provided by the other LLMs: Llama-2 and Mistral. To do this, we will use the `PairwiseComparisonEvaluator` class. What this judge will do then is it will compare the two answers and provide a verdict as to whether Llama-2’s answer is better, Mistral’s answer is better, or if it’s a tie.
There is a bit of added nuance here since with pairwise evaluations, we have to be mindful of the potential for “position-bias”. This is when the judge favours the first answer that was presented to it (within the prompt/context). To account for this position-bias, we invoke the GPT-4 judge to perform to evaluations per sample, where in the second evaluation, we switch the order of presentation of the two answers (i.e., first evaluation: Llama-2 then Mistral, second evaluation: Mistral then Llama-2).
Finally, we also use the `OpenAIFineTuningHandler` which will collect all the chat histories that we will eventually need to fine-tune GPT-3.5.
NOTE: this will take some time to generate the judgements. Again, you have the option to load the `train_qa.jsonl` as `train_dataset`. Moreover, we also stored the JSONL files that we passed to OpenAI to fine-tune GPT-3.5.

```

#### Special Care To The Fine-Tuning JSONL
[Section titled “Special Care To The Fine-Tuning JSONL”](https://developers.llamaindex.ai/python/examples/finetuning/llm_judge/pairwise/finetune_llm_judge/#special-care-to-the-fine-tuning-jsonl)
Since there are two evaluations (one for original order of presentation of the LLM answers and another for a flipped ordering), we need to be careful to choose the correct one to keep in our fine-tuning dataset. What this means is that we need to pick off the correct events that were collected by our `OpenAIFineTuningHandler` and then only use those to prepare the JSONL which we will pass to OpenAI’s fine-tuning API.

Okay, it’s now time to distill some knowledge from GPT-4 to GPT-3.5 To do this, we will make use of the `OpenAIFinetuneEngine` class as well as the `resolved_pairwise_finetuning_events.jsonl` file that we just created.

But first, remember that we said we’d hold off on creating the `test_dataset` until the time comes that we need it? Well, that time is now. So we will repeat the process of creating the `train_dataset` here but instead now for the `test_dataset`.
NOTE: generating these answers and evaluations will take some time. You have the option of loading `test_qa_complete.jsonl` which has all the evaluations from the three considered LLM judges. You can load that as `test_dataset` and run the code found in the Metrics subsection below.

```


import random




# Use Llama-2 and Mistral LLMs to generate the answers to the test queries



test_dataset = []




forin tqdm.tqdm(test_questions):




# randomly select two LLMs to generate answers to this q




model_versus = random.sample(list(test_query_engines.items()), 2)





# data for this q




data_entry = {"question": q}




responses = []




source =None





# generate answers




for name, engine in model_versus:




response = engine.query(q)




response_struct = {}




response_struct["model"] = name




response_struct["text"] =str(response)




if source isnotNone:




assert source == response.source_nodes[0].node.text[:1000] +"..."




else:




source = response.source_nodes[0].node.text[:1000] +"..."




responses.append(response_struct)





data_entry["answers"] = responses




data_entry["source"] = source




test_dataset.append(data_entry)

### The Metrics
[Section titled “The Metrics”](https://developers.llamaindex.ai/python/examples/finetuning/llm_judge/pairwise/finetune_llm_judge/#the-metrics)
Phew! Now that we have generated all of the LLM judges evaluations of the Llama-2/Mistral answers on the test queries. Let’s now get a quantitative view on how close fine-tuned GPT-3.5 is to GPT-4.
For this, we report several metrics, namely:
  * Agreement Rate with GPT-4 evaluations
  * Correlation to GPT-4 evaluations
  * Jaccard Similarity to GPT-4 evaluations


We also report the “inconclusive” counts, which is when the LLM judge switches its decision after being presented with the flipped order of presentation of Llama-2 and Mistral answers. Higher inconclusive counts is an indication of the LLM judge being susceptible to position bias, which is no good!

## Conclusion
[Section titled “Conclusion”](https://developers.llamaindex.ai/python/examples/finetuning/llm_judge/pairwise/finetune_llm_judge/#conclusion)
From the above numbers we see that fine-tuning a GPT-3.5 judge yields higher agreement scores, correlation, and jaccard similarity than a non-fine-tuned GPT-3.5 judge. What’s more is that we see the inconclusive counts go down after fine-tuning as well. Overall, we see that fine-tuning here has helped us to get a GPT-3.5 judge that is closer to a GPT-4 judge (and thus by proxy, closer to human judgements) and at the same time helped remedy the position bias that a non-fine-tuned GPT-3.5 would have otherwise.
