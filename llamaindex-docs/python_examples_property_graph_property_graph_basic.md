# Property Graph Index 
In this notebook, we demonstrate some basic usage of the `PropertyGraphIndex` in LlamaIndex.
The property graph index here will take unstructured documents, extract a property graph from it, and provide various methods to query that graph.

```


%pip install llama-index


```

## Setup
[Section titled “Setup”](https://developers.llamaindex.ai/python/examples/property_graph/property_graph_basic/#setup)

```


import os





os.environ["OPENAI_API_KEY"] ="sk-proj-..."


```


```


!mkdir -p 'data/paul_graham/'




!wget 'https://raw.githubusercontent.com/run-llama/llama_index/main/docs/examples/data/paul_graham/paul_graham_essay.txt'-O 'data/paul_graham/paul_graham_essay.txt'


```


```


import nest_asyncio




nest_asyncio.apply()

```


```


from llama_index.core import SimpleDirectoryReader





documents = SimpleDirectoryReader("./data/paul_graham/").load_data()


```

## Construction
[Section titled “Construction”](https://developers.llamaindex.ai/python/examples/property_graph/property_graph_basic/#construction)

```


from llama_index.core import PropertyGraphIndex




from llama_index.embeddings.openai import OpenAIEmbedding




from llama_index.llms.openai import OpenAI





index = PropertyGraphIndex.from_documents(




documents,




llm=OpenAI(model="gpt-3.5-turbo", temperature=0.3),




embed_model=OpenAIEmbedding(model_name="text-embedding-3-small"),




show_progress=True,



```


```

Parsing nodes: 100%|██████████| 1/1 [00:00<00:00, 25.46it/s]

Generating embeddings: 100%|██████████| 5/5 [00:00<00:00,  5.43it/s]

```

So lets recap what exactly just happened
  * `PropertyGraphIndex.from_documents()` - we loaded documents into an index
  * `Parsing nodes` - the index parsed the documents into nodes
  * `Extracting paths from text` - the nodes were passed to an LLM, and the LLM was prompted to generate knowledge graph triples (i.e. paths)
  * `Extracting implicit paths` - each `node.relationships` property was used to infer implicit paths
  * `Generating embeddings` - embeddings were generated for each text node and graph node (hence this happens twice)


Lets explore what we created! For debugging purposes, the default `SimplePropertyGraphStore` includes a helper to save a `networkx` representation of the graph to an `html` file.

```


index.property_graph_store.save_networkx_graph(name="./kg.html")


```

Opening the html in a browser, we can see our graph!
If you zoom in, each “dense” node with many connections is actually the source chunk, with extracted entities and relations branching off from there.
## Customizing Low-Level Construction
[Section titled “Customizing Low-Level Construction”](https://developers.llamaindex.ai/python/examples/property_graph/property_graph_basic/#customizing-low-level-construction)
If we wanted, we can do the same ingestion using the low-level API, leverage `kg_extractors`.

```


from llama_index.core.indices.property_graph import (




ImplicitPathExtractor,




SimpleLLMPathExtractor,






index = PropertyGraphIndex.from_documents(




documents,




embed_model=OpenAIEmbedding(model_name="text-embedding-3-small"),




kg_extractors=[




ImplicitPathExtractor(),




SimpleLLMPathExtractor(




llm=OpenAI(model="gpt-3.5-turbo", temperature=0.3),




num_workers=4,




max_paths_per_chunk=10,






show_progress=True,



```

For a full guide on all extractors, see the [detailed usage page](https://developers.llamaindex.ai/module_guides/indexing/lpg_index_guide#construction).
## Querying
[Section titled “Querying”](https://developers.llamaindex.ai/python/examples/property_graph/property_graph_basic/#querying)
Querying a property graph index typically consists of using one or more sub-retrievers and combining results.
Graph retrieval can be thought of
  * selecting node(s)
  * traversing from those nodes


By default, two types of retrieval are used in unison
  * synoynm/keyword expansion - use the LLM to generate synonyms and keywords from the query
  * vector retrieval - use embeddings to find nodes in your graph


Once nodes are found, you can either
  * return the paths adjacent to the selected nodes (i.e. triples)
  * return the paths + the original source text of the chunk (if available)



```


retriever = index.as_retriever(




include_text=False# include source text, default True






nodes = retriever.retrieve("What happened at Interleaf and Viaweb?")





for node in nodes:




print(node.text)


```


```

Interleaf -> Was -> On the way down


Viaweb -> Had -> Code editor


Interleaf -> Built -> Impressive technology


Interleaf -> Added -> Scripting language


Interleaf -> Made -> Scripting language


Viaweb -> Suggested -> Take to hospital


Interleaf -> Had done -> Something bold


Viaweb -> Called -> After


Interleaf -> Made -> Dialect of lisp


Interleaf -> Got crushed by -> Moore's law


Dan giffin -> Worked for -> Viaweb


Interleaf -> Had -> Smart people


Interleaf -> Had -> Few years to live


Interleaf -> Made -> Software


Interleaf -> Made -> Software for creating documents


Paul graham -> Started -> Viaweb


Scripting language -> Was -> Dialect of lisp


Scripting language -> Is -> Dialect of lisp


Software -> Will be affected by -> Rapid change


Code editor -> Was -> In viaweb


Software -> Worked via -> Web


Programs -> Typed on -> Punch cards


Computers -> Skipped -> Step


Idea -> Was clear from -> Experience


Apartment -> Wasn't -> Rent-controlled

```


```


query_engine = index.as_query_engine(




include_text=True,






response = query_engine.query("What happened at Interleaf and Viaweb?")





print(str(response))


```


```

Interleaf had smart people and built impressive technology, including adding a scripting language that was a dialect of Lisp. However, despite their efforts, they were eventually impacted by Moore's Law and faced challenges. Viaweb, on the other hand, was started by Paul Graham and had a code editor where users could define their own page styles using Lisp expressions. Viaweb also suggested taking someone to the hospital and called something "After."

```

## Storage
[Section titled “Storage”](https://developers.llamaindex.ai/python/examples/property_graph/property_graph_basic/#storage)
By default, storage happens using our simple in-memory abstractions - `SimpleVectorStore` for embeddings and `SimplePropertyGraphStore` for the property graph.
We can save and load these to/from disk.

```


index.storage_context.persist(persist_dir="./storage")





from llama_index.core import StorageContext, load_index_from_storage





index = load_index_from_storage(




StorageContext.from_defaults(persist_dir="./storage")



```

### Vector Stores
[Section titled “Vector Stores”](https://developers.llamaindex.ai/python/examples/property_graph/property_graph_basic/#vector-stores)
While some graph databases support vectors (like Neo4j), you can still specify the vector store to use on top of your graph for cases where its not supported, or cases where you want to override.
Below we will combine `ChromaVectorStore` with the default `SimplePropertyGraphStore`.

```


%pip install llama-index-vector-stores-chroma


```


```


from llama_index.core.graph_stores import SimplePropertyGraphStore




from llama_index.vector_stores.chroma import ChromaVectorStore




import chromadb





client = chromadb.PersistentClient("./chroma_db")




collection = client.get_or_create_collection("my_graph_vector_db")





index = PropertyGraphIndex.from_documents(




documents,




embed_model=OpenAIEmbedding(model_name="text-embedding-3-small"),




graph_store=SimplePropertyGraphStore(),




vector_store=ChromaVectorStore(collection=collection),




show_progress=True,






index.storage_context.persist(persist_dir="./storage")


```

Then to load:

```


index = PropertyGraphIndex.from_existing(




SimplePropertyGraphStore.from_persist_dir("./storage"),




vector_store=ChromaVectorStore(chroma_collection=collection),




llm=OpenAI(model="gpt-3.5-turbo", temperature=0.3),



```

This looks slightly different than purely using the storage context, but the syntax is more concise now that we’ve started to mix things together.
