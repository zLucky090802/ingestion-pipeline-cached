# Recursive Retriever + Node References 
This guide shows how you can use recursive retrieval to traverse node relationships and fetch nodes based on “references”.
Node references are a powerful concept. When you first perform retrieval, you may want to retrieve the reference as opposed to the raw text. You can have multiple references point to the same node.
In this guide we explore some different usages of node references:
  * **Chunk references** : Different chunk sizes referring to a bigger chunk
  * **Metadata references** : Summaries + Generated Questions referring to a bigger chunk

## Load Data + Setup
[Section titled “Load Data + Setup”](https://developers.llamaindex.ai/python/framework/integrations/retrievers/recursive_retriever_nodes/#load-data--setup)
In this section we download the Llama 2 paper and create an initial set of nodes (chunk size 1024).

```

The key concepts for safety fine-tuning include supervised safety fine-tuning, safety RLHF (Reinforcement Learning from Human Feedback), and safety context distillation. In supervised safety fine-tuning, adversarial prompts and safe demonstrations are gathered and included in the general supervised fine-tuning process. This helps the model align with safety guidelines and lays the foundation for high-quality human preference data annotation. Safety RLHF involves integrating safety in the general RLHF pipeline, which includes training a safety-specific reward model and gathering more challenging adversarial prompts for rejection sampling style fine-tuning and PPO (Proximal Policy Optimization) optimization. Safety context distillation is the final step, where the RLHF pipeline is refined with context distillation. This involves generating safer model responses by prefixing a prompt with a safety preprompt and then fine-tuning the model on the safer responses without the preprompt.

## Chunk References: Smaller Child Chunks Referring to Bigger Parent Chunk
[Section titled “Chunk References: Smaller Child Chunks Referring to Bigger Parent Chunk”](https://developers.llamaindex.ai/python/framework/integrations/retrievers/recursive_retriever_nodes/#chunk-references-smaller-child-chunks-referring-to-bigger-parent-chunk)
In this usage example, we show how to build a graph of smaller chunks pointing to bigger parent chunks.
During query-time, we retrieve smaller chunks, but we follow references to bigger chunks. This allows us to have more context for synthesis.

## Evaluation
[Section titled “Evaluation”](https://developers.llamaindex.ai/python/framework/integrations/retrievers/recursive_retriever_nodes/#evaluation)
We evaluate how well our recursive retrieval + node reference methods work. We evaluate both chunk references as well as metadata references. We use embedding similarity lookup to retrieve the reference nodes.
We compare both methods against a baseline retriever where we fetch the raw nodes directly.
In terms of metrics, we evaluate using both hit-rate and MRR.
### Dataset Generation
[Section titled “Dataset Generation”](https://developers.llamaindex.ai/python/framework/integrations/retrievers/recursive_retriever_nodes/#dataset-generation)
We first generate a dataset of questions from the set of text chunks.

```

EmbeddingQAFinetuneDataset,





from llama_index.llms.openai import OpenAI

```

# optional



eval_dataset = EmbeddingQAFinetuneDataset.from_json(

```

### Compare Results
[Section titled “Compare Results”](https://developers.llamaindex.ai/python/framework/integrations/retrievers/recursive_retriever_nodes/#compare-results)
We run evaluations on each of the retrievers to measure hit rate and MRR.
We find that retrievers with node references (either chunk or metadata) tend to perform better than retrieving the raw chunks.
