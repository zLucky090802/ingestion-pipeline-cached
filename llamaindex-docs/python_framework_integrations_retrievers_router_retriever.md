# Router Retriever 
In this guide, we define a custom router retriever that selects one or more candidate retrievers in order to execute a given query.
The router (`BaseSelector`) module uses the LLM to dynamically make decisions on which underlying retrieval tools to use. This can be helpful to select one out of a diverse range of data sources. This can also be helpful to aggregate retrieval results across a variety of data sources (if a multi-selector module is used).
This notebook is very similar to the RouterQueryEngine notebook.
### Setup
[Section titled “Setup”](https://developers.llamaindex.ai/python/framework/integrations/retrievers/router_retriever/#setup)
If you’re opening this Notebook on colab, you will probably need to install LlamaIndex 🦙.

```


%pip install llama-index-llms-openai


```


```


!pip install llama-index


```


```


# NOTE: This is ONLY necessary in jupyter notebook.



# Details: Jupyter runs an event-loop behind the scenes.


#          This results in nested event-loops when we start an event-loop to make async queries.


#          This is normally not allowed, we use nest_asyncio to allow it for convenience.



import nest_asyncio




nest_asyncio.apply()

```


```


import logging




import sys





logging.basicConfig(stream=sys.stdout, level=logging.INFO)




logging.getLogger().handlers = []




logging.getLogger().addHandler(logging.StreamHandler(stream=sys.stdout))





from llama_index.core import (




VectorStoreIndex,




SimpleDirectoryReader,




StorageContext,




SimpleKeywordTableIndex,





from llama_index.core import SummaryIndex




from llama_index.core.node_parser import SentenceSplitter




from llama_index.llms.openai import OpenAI


```


```

Note: NumExpr detected 12 cores but "NUMEXPR_MAX_THREADS" not set, so enforcing safe limit of 8.


NumExpr defaulting to 8 threads.

```

### Download Data
[Section titled “Download Data”](https://developers.llamaindex.ai/python/framework/integrations/retrievers/router_retriever/#download-data)

```


!mkdir -p 'data/paul_graham/'




!wget 'https://raw.githubusercontent.com/run-llama/llama_index/main/docs/examples/data/paul_graham/paul_graham_essay.txt'-O 'data/paul_graham/paul_graham_essay.txt'


```

### Load Data
[Section titled “Load Data”](https://developers.llamaindex.ai/python/framework/integrations/retrievers/router_retriever/#load-data)
We first show how to convert a Document into a set of Nodes, and insert into a DocumentStore.

```

# load documents



documents = SimpleDirectoryReader("./data/paul_graham/").load_data()


```


```

# initialize LLM + splitter



llm = OpenAI(model="gpt-4")




splitter = SentenceSplitter(chunk_size=1024)




nodes = splitter.get_nodes_from_documents(documents)


```


```

# initialize storage context (by default it's in-memory)



storage_context = StorageContext.from_defaults()



storage_context.docstore.add_documents(nodes)

```


```

# define



summary_index = SummaryIndex(nodes, storage_context=storage_context)




vector_index = VectorStoreIndex(nodes, storage_context=storage_context)




keyword_index = SimpleKeywordTableIndex(nodes, storage_context=storage_context)


```


```


list_retriever = summary_index.as_retriever()




vector_retriever = vector_index.as_retriever()




keyword_retriever = keyword_index.as_retriever()


```


```


from llama_index.core.tools import RetrieverTool





list_tool = RetrieverTool.from_defaults(




retriever=list_retriever,




description=(




"Will retrieve all context from Paul Graham's essay on What I Worked"




" On. Don't use if the question only requires more specific context."






vector_tool = RetrieverTool.from_defaults(




retriever=vector_retriever,




description=(




"Useful for retrieving specific context from Paul Graham essay on What"




" I Worked On."






keyword_tool = RetrieverTool.from_defaults(




retriever=keyword_retriever,




description=(




"Useful for retrieving specific context from Paul Graham essay on What"




" I Worked On (using entities mentioned in query)"




```

### Define Selector Module for Routing
[Section titled “Define Selector Module for Routing”](https://developers.llamaindex.ai/python/framework/integrations/retrievers/router_retriever/#define-selector-module-for-routing)
There are several selectors available, each with some distinct attributes.
The LLM selectors use the LLM to output a JSON that is parsed, and the corresponding indexes are queried.
The Pydantic selectors (currently only supported by `gpt-4-0613` and `gpt-3.5-turbo-0613` (the default)) use the OpenAI Function Call API to produce pydantic selection objects, rather than parsing raw JSON.
Here we use PydanticSingleSelector/PydanticMultiSelector but you can use the LLM-equivalents as well.

```


from llama_index.core.selectors import LLMSingleSelector, LLMMultiSelector




from llama_index.core.selectors import (




PydanticMultiSelector,




PydanticSingleSelector,





from llama_index.core.retrievers import RouterRetriever




from llama_index.core.response.notebook_utils import display_source_node


```

#### PydanticSingleSelector
[Section titled “PydanticSingleSelector”](https://developers.llamaindex.ai/python/framework/integrations/retrievers/router_retriever/#pydanticsingleselector)

```


retriever = RouterRetriever(




selector=PydanticSingleSelector.from_defaults(llm=llm),




retriever_tools=[




list_tool,




vector_tool,




```


```

# will retrieve all context from the author's life



nodes = retriever.retrieve(




"Can you give me all the context regarding the author's life?"





for node in nodes:




display_source_node(node)


```


```

Selecting retriever 0: This choice is most relevant as it mentions retrieving all context from the essay, which could include information about the author's life..
