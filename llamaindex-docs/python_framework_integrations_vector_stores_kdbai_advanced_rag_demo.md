# Advanced RAG with temporal filters using LlamaIndex and KDB.AI vector store 
##### Note: This example requires a KDB.AI endpoint and API key. Sign up for a free [KDB.AI account](https://kdb.ai/get-started).
[Section titled “Note: This example requires a KDB.AI endpoint and API key. Sign up for a free KDB.AI account.”](https://developers.llamaindex.ai/python/framework/integrations/vector_stores/kdbai_advanced_rag_demo/#note-this-example-requires-a-kdbai-endpoint-and-api-key-sign-up-for-a-free-kdbai-account)
> [KDB.AI](https://kdb.ai/) is a powerful knowledge-based vector database and search engine that allows you to build scalable, reliable AI applications, using real-time data, by providing advanced search, recommendation and personalization.
This example demonstrates how to use KDB.AI to run semantic search, summarization and analysis of financial regulations around some specific moment in time.
To access your end point and API keys, sign up to KDB.AI here.
To set up your development environment, follow the instructions on the KDB.AI pre-requisites page.
The following examples demonstrate some of the ways you can interact with KDB.AI through LlamaIndex.

##### Option 1. KDB.AI Cloud
[Section titled “Option 1. KDB.AI Cloud”](https://developers.llamaindex.ai/python/framework/integrations/vector_stores/kdbai_advanced_rag_demo/#option-1-kdbai-cloud)
To use KDB.AI Cloud, you will need two session details - a URL endpoint and an API key. To get these you can sign up for free [here](https://trykdb.kx.com/kdbai/signup).
You can connect to a KDB.AI Cloud session using `kdbai.Session` and passing the session URL endpoint and API key details from your KDB.AI Cloud portal.
If the environment variables `KDBAI_ENDPOINTS` and `KDBAI_API_KEY` exist on your system containing your KDB.AI Cloud portal details, these variables will automatically be used to connect. If these do not exist, it will prompt you to enter your KDB.AI Cloud portal session URL endpoint and API key details.

```

# Set up KDB.AI endpoint and API key



KDBAI_ENDPOINT= (




os.environ["KDBAI_ENDPOINT"]




if"KDBAI_ENDPOINT"in os.environ

##### Option 2. KDB.AI Server
[Section titled “Option 2. KDB.AI Server”](https://developers.llamaindex.ai/python/framework/integrations/vector_stores/kdbai_advanced_rag_demo/#option-2-kdbai-server)
To use KDB.AI Server, you will need download and run your own container. To do this, you will first need to sign up for free [here](https://trykdb.kx.com/kdbaiserver/signup/).
You will receive an email with the required license file and bearer token needed to download your instance. Follow instructions in the signup email to get your session up and running.
Once the [setup steps](https://code.kx.com/kdbai/gettingStarted/kdb-ai-server-setup.html) are complete you can then connect to your KDB.AI Server session using `kdbai.Session` and passing your local endpoint.

```

# session = kdbai.Session()

```

What was the main financial regulation in the US before the 2008 financial crisis ?






print(result.response)


```


```

The main financial regulation in the US before the 2008 financial crisis was the Gramm-Leach-Bliley Act, enacted in 1999. This act facilitated the affiliation among banks, securities firms, and insurance companies, effectively repealing parts of the Glass-Steagall Act, which had previously separated these financial services. The Gramm-Leach-Bliley Act aimed to enhance competition in the financial services industry by providing a framework for the integration of various financial institutions.

Is the Gramm-Leach-Bliley Act of 1999 enough to prevent the 2008 crisis. Search the document and explain its strenghts and weaknesses to regulate the US stock market.






print(result.response)


```


```

The Gramm-Leach-Bliley Act of 1999 aimed to enhance competition in the financial services industry by allowing affiliations among banks, securities firms, and insurance companies. Its strengths include the repeal of the Glass-Steagall Act, which had previously separated commercial banking from investment banking, thereby enabling financial institutions to diversify their services and potentially increase competition. This diversification could lead to more innovative financial products and services.



However, the Act also has notable weaknesses. By allowing greater affiliations and reducing regulatory barriers, it may have contributed to the creation of "too big to fail" institutions, which posed systemic risks to the financial system. The lack of stringent oversight and the ability for financial holding companies to engage in a wide range of activities without adequate regulation may have led to excessive risk-taking. Additionally, the Act did not sufficiently address the complexities of modern financial products, such as derivatives, which played a significant role in the 2008 financial crisis.



In summary, while the Gramm-Leach-Bliley Act aimed to foster competition and innovation in the financial sector, its regulatory framework may have inadvertently facilitated the conditions that led to the financial crisis, highlighting the need for a more robust regulatory approach to oversee the interconnectedness and risks within the financial system.

print(result.response)


```


```

The analysis of U.S. financial regulations before and after the 2008 financial crisis reveals significant changes aimed at preventing a recurrence of such a crisis.



Before the crisis, the regulatory framework was characterized by a lack of comprehensive oversight, particularly for nonbank financial institutions. The regulatory environment allowed for excessive risk-taking, inadequate capital requirements, and insufficient transparency in financial transactions. This environment contributed to the housing bubble and the subsequent collapse of major financial institutions, leading to widespread economic turmoil.



In response to the crisis, the Dodd-Frank Wall Street Reform and Consumer Protection Act of 2010 was enacted. This legislation introduced several key reforms:



1. **Creation of the Financial Stability Oversight Council (FSOC)**: This body was established to monitor systemic risks and coordinate regulatory efforts across different financial sectors. It has the authority to recommend heightened standards and safeguards for financial activities that could pose risks to financial stability.



2. **Enhanced Regulatory Oversight**: Dodd-Frank imposed stricter regulations on bank holding companies and nonbank financial companies, particularly those with significant assets. This includes requirements for stress testing, capital planning, and the submission of resolution plans to ensure orderly wind-downs in case of failure.



3. **Consumer Protection Measures**: The establishment of the Consumer Financial Protection Bureau (CFPB) aimed to protect consumers from predatory lending practices and ensure transparency in financial products.



4. **Volcker Rule**: This provision restricts proprietary trading by banks and limits their investments in hedge funds and private equity funds, thereby reducing conflicts of interest and excessive risk-taking.



5. **Increased Transparency and Reporting Requirements**: Financial institutions are now required to disclose more information regarding their risk exposures and financial health, which enhances market discipline and investor confidence.



The arguments for these reforms center around the need for a more resilient financial system that can withstand economic shocks. The reforms aim to address the systemic risks that were prevalent before the crisis, ensuring that financial institutions maintain adequate capital buffers and engage in prudent risk management practices.



In conclusion, the regulatory landscape has shifted significantly since the 2008 crisis, with a focus on preventing excessive risk-taking, enhancing transparency, and protecting consumers. These measures are designed to create a more stable financial environment and mitigate the likelihood of future crises.
