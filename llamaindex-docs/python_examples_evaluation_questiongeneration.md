# QuestionGeneration 
This notebook walks through the process of generating a list of questions that could be asked about your data. This is useful for setting up an evaluation pipeline using the `FaithfulnessEvaluator` and `RelevancyEvaluator` evaluation tools.
If you’re opening this Notebook on colab, you will probably need to install LlamaIndex 🦙.

They mentioned that their stories had hardly any plot and were mostly about characters with strong feelings, which they thought made the stories deep.  | What I Worked On February 2021 Before college the two main things I worked on, outside of school, were writing and programming. I didn’t write essays. I wrote what beginning writers were supposed to write then, and probably still are: short stories. My stories were awful. They had hardly any plot, just characters with strong feelings, which I imagined made them deep. The first programs I tried writing were on the IBM 1401 that our school district used for what was then called “data processing.” This was in 9th grade, so I was 13 or 14. The school district’s 1401 happened to be in the basement of our junior high school, and my friend Rich Draves and I got permission to use it. It was like a mini Bond villain’s lair down there, with all these alien-looking machines — CPU, disk drives, printer, card reader — sitting up on a raised floor under bright fluorescent lights. The language we used was an early version of Fortran. You had to type programs on punch cards, then stack them in the…  | YES  |
