# DeepLake Reader 
If you’re opening this Notebook on colab, you will probably need to install LlamaIndex 🦙.

```


%pip install llama-index-readers-deeplake

!pip install llama-index

import getpass




import os




import random




import textwrap





from llama_index.core import VectorStoreIndex




from llama_index.readers.deeplake import DeepLakeReader






os.environ["OPENAI_API_KEY"] = getpass.getpass("open ai api key: ")


```


```


reader = DeepLakeReader()




query_vector = [random.random() forinrange(1536)]




documents = reader.load_data(




query_vector=query_vector,

A hard moment for the author was when he realized that the AI programs of the time were not going



to be able to understand natural language and bridge the gap between what they could do and actually


understanding natural language. He had expected college to help him understand the ultimate truths,


but instead he found that the other fields took up so much of the space of ideas that there wasn't


much left for these supposed ultimate truths. He also found himself in a situation where the


students and faculty had an arrangement that didn't require either to learn or teach anything, and


he was the only one painting the nude model. He was also painting still lives in his bedroom at


night on scraps of canvas due to his financial situation.
