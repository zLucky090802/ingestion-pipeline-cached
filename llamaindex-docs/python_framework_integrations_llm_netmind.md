# Netmind AI LLM 
This notebook shows how to use `Netmind AI` as an LLM. Check out the full list of models [netmind.ai](https://www.netmind.ai/).
Visit <https://www.netmind.ai/> and sign up to get an API key.
## Setup
[Section titled “Setup”](https://developers.llamaindex.ai/python/framework/integrations/llm/netmind/#setup)
If you’re opening this Notebook on colab, you will probably need to install LlamaIndex 🦙.

```


%pip install llama-index-llms-netmind


```


```


!pip install llama-index


```


```


from llama_index.llms.netmind import NetmindLLM


```


```

None of PyTorch, TensorFlow >= 2.0, or Flax have been found. Models won't be available and only tokenizers, configuration and file/data utilities can be used.

```


```

# set api key in env or in llm


# import os


# os.environ["NETMIND_API_KEY"] = "your api key"




llm = NetmindLLM(




model="meta-llama/Llama-3.3-70B-Instruct", api_key="your api key"



```


```


resp = llm.complete("Is 9.9 or 9.11 bigger?")


```


```


print(resp)


```


```

9.11 is bigger than 9.9.

```

#### Call `chat` with a list of messages
[Section titled “Call chat with a list of messages”](https://developers.llamaindex.ai/python/framework/integrations/llm/netmind/#call-chat-with-a-list-of-messages)

```


from llama_index.core.llms import ChatMessage





messages = [




ChatMessage(




role="system", content="You are a pirate with a colorful personality"





ChatMessage(role="user", content="What is your name"),





resp = llm.chat(messages)


```


```


print(resp)


```


```
