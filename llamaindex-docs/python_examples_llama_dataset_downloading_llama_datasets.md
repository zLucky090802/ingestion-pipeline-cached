# Downloading a LlamaDataset from LlamaHub 
You can browse our available benchmark datasets via [llamahub.ai](https://llamahub.ai/). This notebook guide depicts how you can download the dataset and its source text documents. In particular, the `download_llama_dataset` will download the evaluation dataset (i.e., `LabelledRagDataset`) as well as the `Document`’s of the source text files used to build the evaluation dataset in the first place.
Finally, in this notebook, we also demonstrate the end to end workflow of downloading an evaluation dataset, making predictions on it using your own RAG pipeline (query engine) and then evaluating these predictions.

```


%pip install llama-index-llms-openai


```


```


from llama_index.core.llama_dataset import download_llama_dataset




# download and install dependencies



rag_dataset, documents = download_llama_dataset(




"PaulGrahamEssayDataset", "./paul_graham"

With `documents`, you can build your own RAG pipeline, to then predict and perform evaluations to compare against the benchmarks listed in the `DatasetCard` associated with the datasets [llamahub.ai](https://llamahub.ai/).
### Predictions
[Section titled “Predictions”](https://developers.llamaindex.ai/python/examples/llama_dataset/downloading_llama_datasets/#predictions)
**NOTE** : The rest of the notebook illustrates how to manually perform predictions and subsequent evaluations for demonstrative purposes. Alternatively you can use the `RagEvaluatorPack` that will take care of predicting and evaluating using a RAG system that you would have provided.

```


from llama_index.core import VectorStoreIndex




# a basic RAG pipeline, uses defaults



index = VectorStoreIndex.from_documents(documents=documents)




query_engine = index.as_query_engine()


```

You can now create predictions and perform evaluation manually or download the `PredictAndEvaluatePack` to do this for you in a single line of code.

```


import nest_asyncio




nest_asyncio.apply()

```


```

# manually



prediction_dataset =await rag_dataset.amake_predictions_with(




query_engine=query_engine, show_progress=True



```

### Evaluation
[Section titled “Evaluation”](https://developers.llamaindex.ai/python/examples/llama_dataset/downloading_llama_datasets/#evaluation)
Now that we have our predictions, we can perform evaluations on two dimensions:
  1. The generated response: how well the predicted response matches the reference answer.
  2. The retrieved contexts: how well the retrieved contexts for the prediction match the reference contexts.


NOTE: For retrieved contexts, we are unable to use standard retrieval metrics such as `hit rate` and `mean reciprocal rank` due to the fact that doing so requires we have the same index that was used to generate the ground truth data. But, it is not necessary for a `LabelledRagDataset` to be even created by an index. As such, we will use `semantic similarity` between the prediction’s contexts and the reference contexts as a measure of goodness.

```


import tqdm


```

For evaluating the response, we will use the LLM-As-A-Judge pattern. Specifically, we will use `CorrectnessEvaluator`, `FaithfulnessEvaluator` and `RelevancyEvaluator`.
For evaluating the goodness of the retrieved contexts we will use `SemanticSimilarityEvaluator`.

```

# instantiate the gpt-4 judge



from llama_index.llms.openai import OpenAI




from llama_index.core.evaluation import (




CorrectnessEvaluator,




FaithfulnessEvaluator,




RelevancyEvaluator,




SemanticSimilarityEvaluator,






judges = {}





judges["correctness"] = CorrectnessEvaluator(




llm=OpenAI(temperature=0, model="gpt-4"),






judges["relevancy"] = RelevancyEvaluator(




llm=OpenAI(temperature=0, model="gpt-4"),






judges["faithfulness"] = FaithfulnessEvaluator(




llm=OpenAI(temperature=0, model="gpt-4"),






judges["semantic_similarity"] = SemanticSimilarityEvaluator()


```

Loop through the (`labelled_example`, `prediction`) pais and perform the evaluations on each of them individually.

```


evals = {




"correctness": [],




"relevancy": [],




"faithfulness": [],




"context_similarity": [],






for example, prediction in tqdm.tqdm(




zip(rag_dataset.examples, prediction_dataset.predictions)





correctness_result = judges["correctness"].evaluate(




query=example.query,




response=prediction.response,




reference=example.reference_answer,






relevancy_result = judges["relevancy"].evaluate(




query=example.query,




response=prediction.response,




contexts=prediction.contexts,






faithfulness_result = judges["faithfulness"].evaluate(




query=example.query,




response=prediction.response,




contexts=prediction.contexts,






semantic_similarity_result = judges["semantic_similarity"].evaluate(




query=example.query,




response="\n".join(prediction.contexts),




reference="\n".join(example.reference_contexts),






evals["correctness"].append(correctness_result)




evals["relevancy"].append(relevancy_result)




evals["faithfulness"].append(faithfulness_result)




evals["context_similarity"].append(semantic_similarity_result)


```


```

44it [07:15,  9.90s/it]

```


```


import json




# saving evaluations



evaluations_objects = {




"context_similarity": [e.dict() forin evals["context_similarity"]],




"correctness": [e.dict() forin evals["correctness"]],




"faithfulness": [e.dict() forin evals["faithfulness"]],




"relevancy": [e.dict() forin evals["relevancy"]],






withopen("evaluations.json", "w") as json_file:




json.dump(evaluations_objects, json_file)


```

Now, we can use our notebook utility functions to view these evaluations.

```


import pandas as pd




from llama_index.core.evaluation.notebook_utils import get_eval_results_df





deep_eval_df, mean_correctness_df = get_eval_results_df(




["base_rag"] *len(evals["correctness"]),




evals["correctness"],




metric="correctness",





deep_eval_df, mean_relevancy_df = get_eval_results_df(




["base_rag"] *len(evals["relevancy"]),




evals["relevancy"],




metric="relevancy",





_, mean_faithfulness_df = get_eval_results_df(




["base_rag"] *len(evals["faithfulness"]),




evals["faithfulness"],




metric="faithfulness",





_, mean_context_similarity_df = get_eval_results_df(




["base_rag"] *len(evals["context_similarity"]),




evals["context_similarity"],




metric="context_similarity",






mean_scores_df = pd.concat(





mean_correctness_df.reset_index(),




mean_relevancy_df.reset_index(),




mean_faithfulness_df.reset_index(),




mean_context_similarity_df.reset_index(),





axis=0,




ignore_index=True,





mean_scores_df = mean_scores_df.set_index("index")




mean_scores_df.index = mean_scores_df.index.set_names(["metrics"])


```


```

mean_scores_df

```


```

.dataframe tbody tr th {



vertical-align: top;





.dataframe thead th {



text-align: right;



```
  
| rag  | base_rag  |  
| --- | --- |  
| metrics  |  
| mean_correctness_score  | 4.238636  |  
| mean_relevancy_score  | 0.977273  |  
| mean_faithfulness_score  | 0.977273  |  
| mean_context_similarity_score  | 0.933568  |  
On this toy example, we see that the basic RAG pipeline performs quite well against the evaluation benchmark (`rag_dataset`)! For completeness, to perform the above steps instead by using the `RagEvaluatorPack`, use the code provided below:

```


from llama_index.core.llama_pack import download_llama_pack





RagEvaluatorPack = download_llama_pack("RagEvaluatorPack", "./pack")




rag_evaluator = RagEvaluatorPack(




query_engine=query_engine, rag_dataset=rag_dataset, show_progress=True
