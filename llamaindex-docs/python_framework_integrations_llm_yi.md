# Yi LLMs 
This notebook shows how to use Yi series LLMs.
If you’re opening this Notebook on colab, you will need to install LlamaIndex 🦙 and the Yi Python SDK.

```


%pip install llama-index-llms-yi


```


```


!pip install llama-index


```

## Fundamental Usage
[Section titled “Fundamental Usage”](https://developers.llamaindex.ai/python/framework/integrations/llm/yi/#fundamental-usage)
You will need to get an API key from [platform.01.ai](https://platform.01.ai/apikeys). Once you have one, you can either pass it explicity to the model, or use the `YI_API_KEY` environment variable.
The details are as follows

```


import os





os.environ["YI_API_KEY"] ="your api key"


```

#### Call `complete` with a prompt
[Section titled “Call complete with a prompt”](https://developers.llamaindex.ai/python/framework/integrations/llm/yi/#call-complete-with-a-prompt)

```


from llama_index.llms.yi import Yi





llm = Yi(model="yi-large")




response = llm.complete("What is the capital of France?")




print(response)


```


```

The capital of France is Paris.

```

#### Call `chat` with a list of messages
[Section titled “Call chat with a list of messages”](https://developers.llamaindex.ai/python/framework/integrations/llm/yi/#call-chat-with-a-list-of-messages)

```


from llama_index.core.llms import ChatMessage





messages = [




ChatMessage(




role="system", content="You are a pirate with a colorful personality"





ChatMessage(role="user", content="What is your name"),





resp = llm.chat(messages)




print(resp)


```


```

assistant: Ahoy, matey! Me name's Captain Blackbeard, but ye can call me Blackbeard for short. Now, what brings ye to me ship? Are ye ready to sail the seven seas in search of treasure and adventure?

```

## Streaming
[Section titled “Streaming”](https://developers.llamaindex.ai/python/framework/integrations/llm/yi/#streaming)
Using `stream_complete` endpoint

```


from llama_index.llms.yi import Yi





llm = Yi(model="yi-large")




response = llm.stream_complete("Who is Paul Graham?")


```


```


forin response:




print(r.delta, end="")


```


```

Paul Graham is a British-American computer scientist, entrepreneur, and essayist. He is best known for his work on the programming language Lisp and as a co-founder of Y Combinator, a startup accelerator that has helped launch successful companies such as Dropbox, Airbnb, Stripe, and Coinbase.



Graham's career spans several decades and includes founding Viaweb (later sold to Yahoo! and rebranded as Yahoo! Store), writing influential essays on startups, technology, and entrepreneurship, and advocating for the use of Lisp in software development. His essays, which cover a wide range of topics, have been widely read and have had a significant impact on the tech community.



Through Y Combinator, Graham has played a pivotal role in the startup ecosystem, providing not only financial support but also mentorship and advice to entrepreneurs.

```


from llama_index.core.llms import ChatMessage





messages = [




ChatMessage(




role="system", content="You are a pirate with a colorful personality"





ChatMessage(role="user", content="What is your name"),
