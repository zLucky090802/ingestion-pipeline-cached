# Comparing Methods for Structured Retrieval (Auto-Retrieval vs. Recursive Retrieval) 
In a naive RAG system, the set of input documents are then chunked, embedded, and dumped to a vector database collection. Retrieval would just fetch the top-k documents by embedding similarity.
This can fail if the set of documents is large - it can be hard to disambiguate raw chunks, and you’re not guaranteed to filter for the set of documents that contain relevant context.
In this guide we explore **structured retrieval** - more advanced query algorithms that take advantage of structure within your documents for higher-precision retrieval. We compare the following two methods:
  * **Metadata Filters + Auto-Retrieval** : Tag each document with the right set of metadata. During query-time, use auto-retrieval to infer metadata filters along with passing through the query string for semantic search.
  * **Store Document Hierarchies (summaries - > raw chunks) + Recursive Retrieval**: Embed document summaries and map that to the set of raw chunks for each document. During query-time, do recursive retrieval to first fetch summaries before fetching documents.

## Metadata Filters + Auto-Retrieval
[Section titled “Metadata Filters + Auto-Retrieval”](https://developers.llamaindex.ai/python/framework/integrations/retrievers/auto_vs_recursive_retriever/#metadata-filters--auto-retrieval)
In this approach, we tag each Document with metadata (category, country), and store in a Weaviate vector db.
During retrieval-time, we then perform “auto-retrieval” to infer the relevant set of metadata filters.

```

In December 2023, Judge Laurel Beeler ruled that Musk must testify again for the SEC.




== Public perception ==



Though his ventures were influential within their own industries in the 2000s, Musk only became a public figure in the early 2010s. He has been described as an eccentric who makes spontaneous and controversial statements, contrary to other billionaires who prefer reclusiveness to protect their businesses. Vance described people's opinions of Musk as polarized due to his "part philosopher, part troll" role on Twitter.Musk was a partial inspiration for the characterization of Tony Stark in the Marvel film Iron Man (2008). Musk also had a cameo appearance in the film's 2010 sequel, Iron Man 2. Musk has made cameos and appearances in other films such as Machete Kills (2013), Why Him? (2016), and Men in Black: International (2019). Television series in which he has appeared include The Simpsons ("The Musk Who Fell to Earth", 2015), The Big Bang Theory ("The Platonic Permutation", 2015), South Park ("Members Only", 2016), Young Sheldon ("A Patch, a Modem, and a Zantac®", 2017), Rick and Morty ("One Crew over the Crewcoo's Morty", 2019), and Saturday Night Live (2021).

He contributed interviews to the documentaries Racing Extinction (2015) and the Werner Herzog-directed Lo and Behold (2016).Musk was elected a Fellow of the Royal Society (FRS) in 2018. In 2015, he received an honorary doctorate in engineering and technology from Yale University and IEEE Honorary Membership.

He has been a major spokesman for such brands as Nike, Coca-Cola, Chevrolet, Gatorade, McDonald's, Ball Park Franks, Rayovac, Wheaties, Hanes, and MCI. Jordan has had a long relationship with Gatorade, appearing in over 20 commercials for the company since 1991, including the "Be Like Mike" commercials in which a song was sung by children wishing to be like Jordan.Nike created a signature shoe for Jordan, called the Air Jordan, in 1984. One of Jordan's more popular commercials for the shoe involved Spike Lee playing the part of Mars Blackmon.

After his parents divorced in 1980, Musk chose to live primarily with his father. Musk later regretted his decision and became estranged from his father. He has a paternal half-sister and a half-brother.In one incident, after having called a boy whose father had committed suicide "stupid", Musk was severely beaten and thrown down concrete steps. His father derided Elon for his behavior and showed no sympathy for him despite his injuries. He was also an enthusiastic reader of books, later attributing his success in part to having read Benjamin Franklin: An American Life, Lord of the Flies, the Foundation series, and The Hitchhiker's Guide to the Galaxy. At age ten, he developed an interest in computing and video games, teaching himself how to program from the VIC-20 user manual. At age twelve, Musk sold his BASIC-based game Blastar to PC and Office Technology magazine for approximately $500.




=== Education ===


Musk attended Waterkloof House Preparatory School, Bryanston High School, and then Pretoria Boys High School, where he graduated.

**Summary for Michael Jordan: Michael Jordan, often referred to as MJ, is a retired professional basketball player from the United States who is widely considered one of the greatest players in the history of the sport. He played 15 seasons in the NBA, primarily with the Chicago Bulls, and won six NBA championships. His individual accolades include six NBA Finals MVP awards, ten NBA scoring titles, five NBA MVP awards, and fourteen NBA All-Star Game selections. He also holds the NBA records for career regular season scoring average and career playoff scoring average. Jordan briefly retired to play Minor League Baseball, but returned to lead the Bulls to three more championships. He was twice inducted into the Naismith Memorial Basketball Hall of Fame.



After retiring, Jordan became a successful businessman, part-owner and head of basketball operations for the Charlotte Hornets, and owner of 23XI Racing in the NASCAR Cup Series. He has also made significant contributions to charitable causes, donating millions to organizations such as the Make-A-Wish Foundation and Habitat for Humanity. In the entertainment industry, he has appeared in productions like "Space Jam" and "The Last Dance", and has authored several books about his life and career. His influence extends beyond sports, making him a significant cultural figure.

**Summary for Elon Musk: Elon Musk is a globally recognized business magnate and investor, who has founded and led numerous high-profile technology companies. He is the founder, CEO, and chief technology officer of SpaceX, an aerospace manufacturer and space transportation company, and the CEO and product architect of Tesla, Inc., a company specializing in electric vehicles and clean energy. Musk also owns and chairs X Corp, and founded the Boring Company, a tunnel construction and infrastructure company. He co-founded Neuralink, a neurotechnology company, and OpenAI, a nonprofit artificial intelligence research company.



In 2022, Musk acquired Twitter and merged it with X Corp, and also founded xAI, an AI company. Despite his success, he has faced criticism for his controversial statements and management style. Musk was born in South Africa, moved to Canada at 18, and later to the United States to attend Stanford University, but dropped out to start his entrepreneurial journey. He co-founded Zip2 and X.com (later PayPal), which was sold to eBay in 2002.



Musk envisions a future that includes Mars colonization and the development of a high-speed transportation system known as the Hyperloop. As of August 2023, he is the wealthiest person in the world, with a net worth of over $200 billion. Despite various controversies, Musk has made significant contributions to the tech industry. He has been married multiple times, has several children, and is known for his active presence on social media, particularly Twitter.
