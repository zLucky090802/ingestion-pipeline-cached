# RunGPT 
RunGPT is an open-source cloud-native large-scale multimodal models (LMMs) serving framework. It is designed to simplify the deployment and management of large language models, on a distributed cluster of GPUs. RunGPT aim to make it a one-stop solution for a centralized and accessible place to gather techniques for optimizing large-scale multimodal models and make them easy to use for everyone. In RunGPT, we have supported a number of LLMs such as LLaMA, Pythia, StableLM, Vicuna, MOSS, and Large Multi-modal Model(LMMs) like MiniGPT-4 and OpenFlamingo additionally.
# Setup
[Section titled “Setup”](https://developers.llamaindex.ai/python/framework/integrations/llm/rungpt/#setup)
If you’re opening this Notebook on colab, you will probably need to install LlamaIndex 🦙.

```


%pip install llama-index-llms-rungpt


```


```


!pip install llama-index


```

You need to install rungpt package in your python environment with `pip install`

```


!pip install rungpt


```

After installing successfully, models supported by RunGPT can be deployed with an one-line command. This option will download target language model from open source platform and deploy it as a service at a localhost port, which can be accessed by http or grpc requests. I suppose you not run this command in jupyter book, but in command line instead.

```


!rungpt serve decapoda-research/llama-7b-hf --precision fp16 --device_map balanced


```

## Basic Usage
[Section titled “Basic Usage”](https://developers.llamaindex.ai/python/framework/integrations/llm/rungpt/#basic-usage)
#### Call `complete` with a prompt
[Section titled “Call complete with a prompt”](https://developers.llamaindex.ai/python/framework/integrations/llm/rungpt/#call-complete-with-a-prompt)

```


from llama_index.llms.rungpt import RunGptLLM





llm = RunGptLLM()




promot ="What public transportation might be available in a city?"




response = llm.complete(promot)


```


```


print(response)


```


```

I don't want to go to work, so what should I do?


I have a job interview on Monday. What can I wear that will make me look professional but not too stuffy or boring?

```

#### Call `chat` with a list of messages
[Section titled “Call chat with a list of messages”](https://developers.llamaindex.ai/python/framework/integrations/llm/rungpt/#call-chat-with-a-list-of-messages)

```


from llama_index.core.llms import ChatMessage, MessageRole




from llama_index.llms.rungpt import RunGptLLM





messages = [




ChatMessage(




role=MessageRole.USER,




content="Now, I want you to do some math for me.",





ChatMessage(




role=MessageRole.ASSISTANT, content="Sure, I would like to help you."





ChatMessage(




role=MessageRole.USER,




content="How many points determine a straight line?",






llm = RunGptLLM()




response = llm.chat(messages=messages, temperature=0.8, max_tokens=15)


```


```


print(response)


```

## Streaming
[Section titled “Streaming”](https://developers.llamaindex.ai/python/framework/integrations/llm/rungpt/#streaming)
Using `stream_complete` endpoint

```


promot ="What public transportation might be available in a city?"




response = RunGptLLM().stream_complete(promot)




for item in response:




print(item.text)


```

Using `stream_chat` endpoint

```


from llama_index.llms.rungpt import RunGptLLM





messages = [




ChatMessage(




role=MessageRole.USER,




content="Now, I want you to do some math for me.",





ChatMessage(




role=MessageRole.ASSISTANT, content="Sure, I would like to help you."





ChatMessage(




role=MessageRole.USER,




content="How many points determine a straight line?",






response = RunGptLLM().stream_chat(messages=messages)


```


```


for item in response:




print(item.message)
