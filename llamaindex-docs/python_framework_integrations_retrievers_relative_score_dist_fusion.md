# Relative Score Fusion and Distribution-Based Score Fusion 
In this example, we demonstrate using QueryFusionRetriever with two methods which aim to improve on Reciprocal Rank Fusion:
  1. Relative Score Fusion ([Weaviate](https://weaviate.io/blog/hybrid-search-fusion-algorithms))
  2. Distribution-Based Score Fusion ([Mazzeschi: blog post](https://medium.com/plain-simple-software/distribution-based-score-fusion-dbsf-a-new-approach-to-vector-search-ranking-f87c37488b18))



```


%pip install llama-index-llms-openai




%pip install llama-index-retrievers-bm25

## Setup
[Section titled “Setup”](https://developers.llamaindex.ai/python/framework/integrations/retrievers/relative_score_dist_fusion/#setup)
If you’re opening this Notebook on colab, you will probably need to install LlamaIndex 🦙.
Download Data

```


!mkdir -p 'data/paul_graham/'




!wget 'https://raw.githubusercontent.com/run-llama/llama_index/main/docs/examples/data/paul_graham/paul_graham_essay.txt'-O 'data/paul_graham/paul_graham_essay.txt'


```


```


from llama_index.core import SimpleDirectoryReader





documents = SimpleDirectoryReader("./data/paul_graham/").load_data()


```

Next, we will setup a vector index over the documentation.

```


from llama_index.core import VectorStoreIndex




from llama_index.core.node_parser import SentenceSplitter





splitter = SentenceSplitter(chunk_size=256)





index = VectorStoreIndex.from_documents(




documents, transformations=[splitter], show_progress=True



```


```

Parsing nodes: 100%|██████████| 1/1 [00:00<00:00,  7.55it/s]


Generating embeddings: 100%|██████████| 504/504 [00:03<00:00, 128.32it/s]

## Create a Hybrid Fusion Retriever using Relative Score Fusion
[Section titled “Create a Hybrid Fusion Retriever using Relative Score Fusion”](https://developers.llamaindex.ai/python/framework/integrations/retrievers/relative_score_dist_fusion/#create-a-hybrid-fusion-retriever-using-relative-score-fusion)
In this step, we fuse our index with a BM25 based retriever. This will enable us to capture both semantic relations and keywords in our input queries.
Since both of these retrievers calculate a score, we can use the `QueryFusionRetriever` to re-sort our nodes without using an additional models or excessive computation.
The following example uses the [Relative Score Fusion](https://weaviate.io/blog/hybrid-search-fusion-algorithms) algorithm from Weaviate, which applies a MinMax scaler to each result set, then makes a weighted sum. Here, we’ll give the vector retriever slightly more weight than BM25 (0.6 vs. 0.4).
First, we create our retrievers. Each will retrieve the top-10 most similar nodes.

```


from llama_index.retrievers.bm25 import BM25Retriever





vector_retriever = index.as_retriever(similarity_top_k=5)





bm25_retriever = BM25Retriever.from_defaults(




docstore=index.docstore, similarity_top_k=10



```

Next, we can create our fusion retriever, which well return the top-10 most similar nodes from the 20 returned nodes from the retrievers.
Note that the vector and BM25 retrievers may have returned all the same nodes, only in different orders; in this case, it simply acts as a re-ranker.

```


from llama_index.core.retrievers import QueryFusionRetriever





retriever = QueryFusionRetriever(




[vector_retriever, bm25_retriever],




retriever_weights=[0.6, 0.4],




similarity_top_k=10,




num_queries=1# set this to 1 to disable query generation




mode="relative_score",




use_async=True,




verbose=True,



```


```

# apply nested async to run in a notebook



import nest_asyncio




nest_asyncio.apply()

```


```


nodes_with_scores = retriever.retrieve(




"What happened at Interleafe and Viaweb?"



```


```


for node in nodes_with_scores:




print(f"Score: {node.score:.2f}{node.text[:100]}...\n-----")


```

### Distribution-Based Score Fusion
[Section titled “Distribution-Based Score Fusion”](https://developers.llamaindex.ai/python/framework/integrations/retrievers/relative_score_dist_fusion/#distribution-based-score-fusion)
A variant on Relative Score Fusion, [Distribution-Based Score Fusion](https://medium.com/plain-simple-software/distribution-based-score-fusion-dbsf-a-new-approach-to-vector-search-ranking-f87c37488b18) scales the scores a bit differently - based on the mean and standard deviation of the scores for each result set.

```


from llama_index.core.retrievers import QueryFusionRetriever





retriever = QueryFusionRetriever(




[vector_retriever, bm25_retriever],




retriever_weights=[0.6, 0.4],




similarity_top_k=10,




num_queries=1# set this to 1 to disable query generation




mode="dist_based_score",




use_async=True,




verbose=True,






nodes_with_scores = retriever.retrieve(




"What happened at Interleafe and Viaweb?"






for node in nodes_with_scores:




print(f"Score: {node.score:.2f}{node.text[:100]}...\n-----")


```


```

## Use in a Query Engine!
[Section titled “Use in a Query Engine!”](https://developers.llamaindex.ai/python/framework/integrations/retrievers/relative_score_dist_fusion/#use-in-a-query-engine)
Now, we can plug our retriever into a query engine to synthesize natural language responses.

```


from llama_index.core.query_engine import RetrieverQueryEngine





query_engine = RetrieverQueryEngine.from_args(retriever)


```


```


response = query_engine.query("What happened at Interleafe and Viaweb?")


```


```


from llama_index.core.response.notebook_utils import display_response




display_response(response)

```

**`Final Response:`**At Interleaf, there was a group called Release Engineering that was as large as the group writing the software. They had to deal with versions, ports, and other complexities. In contrast, at Viaweb, the software could be updated directly on the server, simplifying the process. Viaweb was founded with $10,000 in seed funding, and the software allowed building a whole store through the browser without the need for client software or command line inputs on the server. The company aimed to be easy to use and inexpensive, offering low monthly prices for their services.
