# RAG CLI
One common use case is chatting with an LLM about files you have saved locally on your computer.
We have written a CLI tool to help you do just that! You can point the rag CLI tool to a set of files you’ve saved locally, and it will ingest those files into a local vector database that is then used for a Chat Q&A repl within your terminal.
By default, this tool uses OpenAI for the embeddings & LLM as well as a local Chroma Vector DB instance. **Warning** : this means that, by default, the local data you ingest with this tool _will_ be sent to OpenAI’s API.
However, you do have the ability to customize the models and databases used in this tool. This includes the possibility of running all model execution locally! See the **Customization** section below.
## Setup
[Section titled “Setup”](https://developers.llamaindex.ai/python/framework/getting_started/starter_tools/rag_cli/#setup)
To set-up the CLI tool, make sure you’ve installed the library:
`$ pip install -U llama-index`
You will also need to install [Chroma](https://developers.llamaindex.ai/python/examples/vector_stores/chromaindexdemo):
`$ pip install -U chromadb`
After that, you can start using the tool:
Terminal window
```


$llamaindex-clirag-h




usage:llamaindex-clirag [-h] [-q QUESTION] [-f FILES [FILES ...]] [-c] [-v] [--clear] [--create-llama]




options:

-v,--verboseWhethertoprintoutverboseinformationduringexecution.

```

## Usage
[Section titled “Usage”](https://developers.llamaindex.ai/python/framework/getting_started/starter_tools/rag_cli/#usage)
Here are some high level steps to get you started:
  1. **Set the`OPENAI_API_KEY` environment variable:** By default, this tool uses OpenAI’s API. As such, you’ll need to ensure the OpenAI API Key is set under the `OPENAI_API_KEY` environment variable whenever you use the tool. 
Terminal window
```


$exportOPENAI_API_KEY=<api_key>


```

  2. **Ingest some files:** Now, you need to point the tool at some local files that it can ingest into the local vector database. For this example, we’ll ingest the LlamaIndex `README.md` file: 
Terminal window
```


$llamaindex-clirag--files"./README.md"


```

You can also specify a file glob pattern such as: 
Terminal window
```


$llamaindex-clirag--files"./docs/**/*.rst"


```

  3. **Ask a Question** : You can now start asking questions about any of the documents you’d ingested in the prior step: 
Terminal window
```


$llamaindex-clirag--question"What is LlamaIndex?"




LlamaIndexisadataframeworkthathelpsiningesting,structuring,andaccessingprivateordomain-specificdataforLLM-basedapplications.Itprovidestoolssuchasdataconnectorstoingestdatafromvarioussources,dataindexestostructurethedata,andenginesfornaturallanguageaccesstothedata.LlamaIndexfollowsaRetrieval-AugmentedGeneration (RAG) approach, where it retrieves information from data sources, adds it to the question as context, and thenaskstheLLMtogenerateananswerbasedontheenrichedprompt.Thisapproachovercomesthelimitationsoffine-tuningLLMsandprovidesamorecost-effective,up-to-date,andtrustworthysolutionfordataaugmentation.LlamaIndexisdesignedforbothbeginnerandadvancedusers,withahigh-levelAPIforeasyusageandlower-levelAPIsforcustomizationandextension.


```

  4. **Open a Chat REPL** : You can even open a chat interface within your terminal! Just run `$ llamaindex-cli rag --chat` and start asking questions about the files you’ve ingested.


### Create a LlamaIndex chat application
[Section titled “Create a LlamaIndex chat application”](https://developers.llamaindex.ai/python/framework/getting_started/starter_tools/rag_cli/#create-a-llamaindex-chat-application)
You can also create a full-stack chat application with a FastAPI backend and NextJS frontend based on the files that you have selected.
To bootstrap the application, make sure you have NodeJS and npx installed on your machine. If not, please refer to the [LlamaIndex.TS](https://ts.llamaindex.ai/docs/llamaindex/getting_started) documentation for instructions.
Once you have everything set up, creating a new application is easy. Simply run the following command:
`$ llamaindex-cli rag --create-llama`
It will call our `create-llama` tool, so you will need to provide several pieces of information to create the app. You can find more information about the `create-llama` on [npmjs - create-llama](https://www.npmjs.com/package/create-llama#example)
Terminal window
```


❯llamaindex-clirag--create-llama

Generatecodeandinstalldependencies (~2 min)




❯Generatecode,installdependencies,andruntheapp (~2 min)



```

If you choose the option `Generate code, install dependencies, and run the app (~2 min)`, all dependencies will be installed and the app will run automatically. You can then access the application by going to this address: <http://localhost:3000>.
### Supported File Types
[Section titled “Supported File Types”](https://developers.llamaindex.ai/python/framework/getting_started/starter_tools/rag_cli/#supported-file-types)
Internally, the `rag` CLI tool uses the [SimpleDirectoryReader](https://developers.llamaindex.ai/python/framework/module_guides/loading/simpledirectoryreader) to parse the raw files in your local filesystem into strings.
This module has custom readers for a wide variety of file types. Some of those may require that you `pip install` another module that is needed for parsing that particular file type.
If a file type is encountered with a file extension that the `SimpleDirectoryReader` does not have a custom reader for, it will just read the file as a plain text file.
See the next section for information on how to add your own custom file readers + customize other aspects of the CLI tool!
## Customization
[Section titled “Customization”](https://developers.llamaindex.ai/python/framework/getting_started/starter_tools/rag_cli/#customization)
The `rag` CLI tool is highly customizable! The tool is powered by combining the [`IngestionPipeline`](https://developers.llamaindex.ai/python/framework/module_guides/loading/ingestion_pipeline) module within the [`RagCLI`](https://github.com/run-llama/llama_index/blob/main/llama-index-cli/llama_index/cli/rag/base.py) module.
To create your own custom rag CLI tool, you can simply create a script that instantiates the `RagCLI` class with a `IngestionPipeline` that you’ve configured yourself. From there, you can simply run `rag_cli_instance.cli()` in your script to run the same ingestion and Q&A commands against your own choice of embedding models, LLMs, vector DBs, etc.
Here’s some high-level code to show the general setup:

```

#!/path/to/your/virtualenv/bin/python



import os




from llama_index.core.ingestion import IngestionPipeline, IngestionCache




from llama_index.core.storage.docstore import SimpleDocumentStore




from llama_index.cli.rag import RagCLI





# optional, set any API keys your script may need (perhaps using python-dotenv library instead)



os.environ["OPENAI_API_KEY"] ="sk-xxx"





docstore = SimpleDocumentStore()





vec_store =...# your vector store instance




llm =...# your LLM instance - optional, will default to OpenAI gpt-3.5-turbo





custom_ingestion_pipeline = IngestionPipeline(




transformations=[...],




vector_store=vec_store,




docstore=docstore,




cache=IngestionCache(),





# you can optionally specify your own custom readers to support additional file types.



file_extractor = {".html": ...}





rag_cli_instance = RagCLI(




ingestion_pipeline=custom_ingestion_pipeline,




llm=llm,  # optional




file_extractor=file_extractor,  # optional






if__name__=="__main__":




rag_cli_instance.cli()


```

From there, you’re just a few steps away from being able to use your custom CLI script:
  1. Make sure to replace the python path at the top to the one your virtual environment is using _(run`$ which python` while your virtual environment is activated)_
  2. Let’s say you saved your file at `/path/to/your/script/my_rag_cli.py`. From there, you can simply modify your shell’s configuration file _(like`.bashrc` or `.zshrc`)_ with a line like `$ export PATH="/path/to/your/script:$PATH"`.
  3. After that do `$ chmod +x my_rag_cli.py` to give executable permissions to the file.
  4. That’s it! You can now just open a new terminal session and run `$ my_rag_cli.py -h`. You can now run the script with the same parameters but using your custom code configurations!
     * Note: you can remove the `.py` file extension from your `my_rag_cli.py` file if you just want to run the command as `$ my_rag_cli --chat`
