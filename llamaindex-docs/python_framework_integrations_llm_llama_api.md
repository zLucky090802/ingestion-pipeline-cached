# Llama API 
[Llama API](https://www.llama-api.com/) is a hosted API for Llama 2 with function calling support.
## Setup
[Section titled “Setup”](https://developers.llamaindex.ai/python/framework/integrations/llm/llama_api/#setup)
To start, go to <https://www.llama-api.com/> to obtain an API key
If you’re opening this Notebook on colab, you will probably need to install LlamaIndex 🦙.

```


%pip install llama-index-program-openai




%pip install llama-index-llms-llama-api


```


```


!pip install llama-index


```


```


from llama_index.llms.llama_api import LlamaAPI


```


```


api_key ="LL-your-key"


```


```


llm = LlamaAPI(api_key=api_key)


```

## Basic Usage
[Section titled “Basic Usage”](https://developers.llamaindex.ai/python/framework/integrations/llm/llama_api/#basic-usage)
#### Call `complete` with a prompt
[Section titled “Call complete with a prompt”](https://developers.llamaindex.ai/python/framework/integrations/llm/llama_api/#call-complete-with-a-prompt)

```


resp = llm.complete("Paul Graham is ")


```


```


print(resp)


```


```

Paul Graham is a well-known computer scientist and entrepreneur, best known for his work as a co-founder of Viaweb and later Y Combinator, a successful startup accelerator. He is also a prominent essayist and has written extensively on topics such as entrepreneurship, software development, and the tech industry.

```

#### Call `chat` with a list of messages
[Section titled “Call chat with a list of messages”](https://developers.llamaindex.ai/python/framework/integrations/llm/llama_api/#call-chat-with-a-list-of-messages)

```


from llama_index.core.llms import ChatMessage





messages = [




ChatMessage(




role="system", content="You are a pirate with a colorful personality"





ChatMessage(role="user", content="What is your name"),





resp = llm.chat(messages)


```


```


print(resp)


```


```

assistant: Arrrr, me hearty! Me name be Captain Blackbeak, the scurviest dog on the seven seas! Yer lookin' fer a swashbucklin' adventure, eh? Well, hoist the sails and set course fer the high seas, matey! I be here to help ye find yer treasure and battle any scurvy dogs who dare cross our path! So, what be yer first question, landlubber?

```

## Function Calling
[Section titled “Function Calling”](https://developers.llamaindex.ai/python/framework/integrations/llm/llama_api/#function-calling)

```


from pydantic import BaseModel




from llama_index.core.llms.openai_utils import to_openai_function






classSong(BaseModel):




"""A song with name and artist"""





name: str




artist: str






song_fn = to_openai_function(Song)


```


```


llm = LlamaAPI(api_key=api_key)




response = llm.complete("Generate a song", functions=[song_fn])




function_call = response.additional_kwargs["function_call"]




print(function_call)


```


```

{'name': 'Song', 'arguments': {'name': 'Happy', 'artist': 'Pharrell Williams'}}

```

## Structured Data Extraction
[Section titled “Structured Data Extraction”](https://developers.llamaindex.ai/python/framework/integrations/llm/llama_api/#structured-data-extraction)
This is a simple example of parsing an output into an `Album` schema, which can contain multiple songs.
Define output schema

```


from pydantic import BaseModel




from typing import List






classSong(BaseModel):




"""Data model for a song."""





title: str




length_mins: int






classAlbum(BaseModel):




"""Data model for an album."""





name: str




artist: str




songs: List[Song]


```

Define pydantic program (llama API is OpenAI-compatible)

```


from llama_index.program.openai import OpenAIPydanticProgram





prompt_template_str ="""\



Extract album and songs from the text provided.


For each song, make sure to specify the title and the length_mins.


{text}





llm = LlamaAPI(api_key=api_key, temperature=0.0)





program = OpenAIPydanticProgram.from_defaults(




output_cls=Album,




llm=llm,




prompt_template_str=prompt_template_str,




verbose=True,



```

Run program to get structured output.

```


output = program(




text="""




"Echoes of Eternity" is a compelling and thought-provoking album, skillfully crafted by the renowned artist, Seraphina Rivers. \

time and space.



```


```

Function call: Album with args: {'name': 'Echoes of Eternity', 'artist': 'Seraphina Rivers', 'songs': [{'title': 'Stardust Serenade', 'length_mins': 6}, {'title': 'Eclipse of the Soul', 'length_mins': 8}, {'title': 'Infinity Embrace', 'length_mins': 10}]}

```


```

output

```


```

Album(name='Echoes of Eternity', artist='Seraphina Rivers', songs=[Song(title='Stardust Serenade', length_mins=6), Song(title='Eclipse of the Soul', length_mins=8), Song(title='Infinity Embrace', length_mins=10)])
