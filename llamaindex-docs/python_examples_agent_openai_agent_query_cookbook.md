# OpenAI Agent + Query Engine Experimental Cookbook 
In this notebook, we try out the FunctionAgent across a variety of query engine tools and datasets. We explore how FunctionAgent can compare/replace existing workflows solved by our retrievers/query engines.
  * Auto retrieval
  * Joint SQL and vector search


**NOTE:** Any Text-to-SQL application should be aware that executing arbitrary SQL queries can be a security risk. It is recommended to take precautions as needed, such as using restricted roles, read-only databases, sandboxing, etc.
## AutoRetrieval from a Vector Database
[Section titled “AutoRetrieval from a Vector Database”](https://developers.llamaindex.ai/python/examples/agent/openai_agent_query_cookbook/#autoretrieval-from-a-vector-database)
Our existing “auto-retrieval” capabilities (in `VectorIndexAutoRetriever`) allow an LLM to infer the right query parameters for a vector database - including both the query string and metadata filter.
Since the OpenAI Function API can infer function parameters, we explore its capabilities in performing auto-retrieval here.
If you’re opening this Notebook on colab, you will probably need to install LlamaIndex 🦙.

#### Define Function Tool
[Section titled “Define Function Tool”](https://developers.llamaindex.ai/python/examples/agent/openai_agent_query_cookbook/#define-function-tool)
Here we define the function interface, which is passed to OpenAI to perform auto-retrieval.
We were not able to get OpenAI to work with nested pydantic objects or tuples as arguments, so we converted the metadata filter keys and values into lists for the function API to work with.

```

## Joint Text-to-SQL and Semantic Search
[Section titled “Joint Text-to-SQL and Semantic Search”](https://developers.llamaindex.ai/python/examples/agent/openai_agent_query_cookbook/#joint-text-to-sql-and-semantic-search)
This is currently handled by our `SQLAutoVectorQueryEngine`.
Let’s try implementing this by giving our `FunctionAgent` access to two query tools: SQL and Vector
**NOTE:** Any Text-to-SQL application should be aware that executing arbitrary SQL queries can be a security risk. It is recommended to take precautions as needed, such as using restricted roles, read-only databases, sandboxing, etc.
#### Load and Index Structured Data
[Section titled “Load and Index Structured Data”](https://developers.llamaindex.ai/python/examples/agent/openai_agent_query_cookbook/#load-and-index-structured-data)
We load sample structured datapoints into a SQL db and index it.

Called tool vector_tool with args {'input': 'Tell me about the arts and culture of Tokyo.'}, got response: Tokyo boasts a vibrant arts and culture scene, characterized by a diverse range of museums, galleries, and performance venues. Ueno Park is a cultural hub, housing the Tokyo National Museum, which specializes in traditional Japanese art, alongside the National Museum of Western Art, a UNESCO World Heritage site, and the National Museum of Nature and Science. The park also features Ueno Zoo, known for its giant pandas.



The city is home to numerous notable museums, including the Artizon Museum, the National Museum of Emerging Science and Innovation, and the Edo-Tokyo Museum, which explores the city's history. Contemporary art is showcased at the Mori Art Museum and the Sumida Hokusai Museum, while the Sompo Museum of Art is recognized for its collection, including Van Gogh's "Sunflowers."



The performing arts thrive in Tokyo, with venues like the National Noh Theatre and Kabuki-za dedicated to traditional Japanese theatre. The New National Theatre Tokyo hosts a variety of performances, including opera and ballet. Major concert venues such as the Nippon Budokan and Tokyo Dome frequently feature popular music acts.



Tokyo's nightlife is vibrant, particularly in districts like Shibuya and Roppongi, which are filled with bars, clubs, and live music venues. The city is also known for its festivals, such as the Sannō Matsuri and the Sanja Festival, which celebrate traditional culture.



Shopping districts like Ginza and Nihombashi offer a blend of high-end retail and cultural experiences, while areas like Jinbōchō are famous for their literary connections, featuring bookstores and cafes linked to renowned authors. Overall, Tokyo's arts and culture reflect a rich tapestry of traditional and contemporary influences, making it a dynamic city for cultural exploration.

Called tool vector_tool with args {'input': 'Tell me about the history of Berlin.'}, got response: Berlin's history dates back to prehistoric times, with evidence of human settlements as early as 60,000 BC. The area saw the emergence of various cultures, including the Maglemosian culture around 9,000 BC and the Lusatian culture around 2,000 BC, as dense human settlements developed along the Spree and Havel rivers. By 500 BC, Germanic tribes began to settle in the region, followed by Slavic tribes in the 7th century.



In the 12th century, the region came under German rule with the establishment of the Margraviate of Brandenburg. The first written records of towns in the area appear in the late 12th century, with Berlin's founding date considered to be 1237. The towns of Berlin and Cölln formed close economic ties and eventually merged, with the Hohenzollern family ruling the area from the 14th century until 1918.



The Thirty Years' War in the 17th century devastated Berlin, leading to significant population loss. However, under Frederick William, known as the "Great Elector," the city experienced a revival through policies promoting immigration and religious tolerance. The establishment of the Kingdom of Prussia in 1701 marked a significant turning point, with Berlin becoming its capital.



The 19th century brought the Industrial Revolution, transforming Berlin into a major economic center and leading to rapid population growth. By the late 19th century, Berlin was the capital of the newly founded German Empire. The city continued to grow and evolve through the 20th century, experiencing significant events such as World War II, the division into East and West Berlin during the Cold War, and reunification in 1990, when it once again became the capital of a unified Germany.



Today, Berlin is recognized as a global city of culture, politics, media, and science, with a diverse economy and rich historical heritage.
