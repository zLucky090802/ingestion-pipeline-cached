# Colbert Rerank 
If you’re opening this Notebook on colab, you will probably need to install LlamaIndex 🦙.
[Colbert](https://github.com/stanford-futuredata/ColBERT): ColBERT is a fast and accurate retrieval model, enabling scalable BERT-based search over large text collections in tens of milliseconds.
This example shows how we use Colbert-V2 model as a reranker.
