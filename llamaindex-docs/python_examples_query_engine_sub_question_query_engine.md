# Sub Question Query Engine 
In this tutorial, we showcase how to use a **sub question query engine** to tackle the problem of answering a complex query using multiple data sources. It first breaks down the complex query into sub questions for each relevant data source, then gather all the intermediate reponses and synthesizes a final response.
### Preparation
[Section titled “Preparation”](https://developers.llamaindex.ai/python/examples/query_engine/sub_question_query_engine/#preparation)
If you’re opening this Notebook on colab, you will probably need to install LlamaIndex 🦙.

```


!pip install llama-index


```


```


import os





os.environ["OPENAI_API_KEY"] ="sk-..."





import nest_asyncio




nest_asyncio.apply()

```


```


from llama_index.core import VectorStoreIndex, SimpleDirectoryReader




from llama_index.core.tools import QueryEngineTool, ToolMetadata




from llama_index.core.query_engine import SubQuestionQueryEngine




from llama_index.core.callbacks import CallbackManager, LlamaDebugHandler




from llama_index.core import Settings


```


```

# Using the LlamaDebugHandler to print the trace of the sub questions


# captured by the SUB_QUESTION callback event type



llama_debug = LlamaDebugHandler(print_trace_on_end=True)




callback_manager = CallbackManager([llama_debug])





Settings.callback_manager = callback_manager


```

### Download Data
[Section titled “Download Data”](https://developers.llamaindex.ai/python/examples/query_engine/sub_question_query_engine/#download-data)

```


!mkdir -p 'data/paul_graham/'




!wget 'https://raw.githubusercontent.com/run-llama/llama_index/main/docs/examples/data/paul_graham/paul_graham_essay.txt'-O 'data/paul_graham/paul_graham_essay.txt'


```


```

### Setup sub question query engine
[Section titled “Setup sub question query engine”](https://developers.llamaindex.ai/python/examples/query_engine/sub_question_query_engine/#setup-sub-question-query-engine)

```

# setup base query engine as tool

### Run queries
[Section titled “Run queries”](https://developers.llamaindex.ai/python/examples/query_engine/sub_question_query_engine/#run-queries)

```


response = query_engine.query(




"How was Paul Grahams life different before, during, and after YC?"
