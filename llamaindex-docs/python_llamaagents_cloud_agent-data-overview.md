# Agent Data
### What is Agent Data?
[Section titled “What is Agent Data?”](https://developers.llamaindex.ai/python/llamaagents/cloud/agent-data-overview/#what-is-agent-data)
Skip the database setup. LlamaAgents workflows and JavaScript UIs share a persistent Agent Data store built into the LlamaCloud API. It uses the same authentication as the rest of the API.
Agent Data is a queryable store for JSON records produced by your agents. Each record is linked to a `deployment_name` (the deployed agent) and an optional `collection` (a logical bucket; defaults to `default`). Use it to persist extractions, events, metrics, and other structured output, then search and aggregate across records.
Key concepts:
  * **deployment_name** : the identifier of the agent deployment the data belongs to. Access is authorized against that agent’s project.
  * **collection** : a logical namespace within an agent for organizing different data types or apps. Storage is JSON. We recommend storing homogeneous data types within a single collection.
  * **data** : the JSON payload shaped by your app. SDKs provide typed wrappers.


Important behavior and constraints:
  * **Deployment required** : The `deployment_name` must correspond to an existing deployment. Data is associated with that deployment and its project.
  * **Local development** : When running locally, omit `deployment_name` to use the shared `_public` Agent Data store. Use distinct `collection` names to separate apps during local development.
  * **Access control** : You can only read/write data for agents in projects you can access. `_public` data is visible across agents within the same project.


### SDK Reference
[Section titled “SDK Reference”](https://developers.llamaindex.ai/python/llamaagents/cloud/agent-data-overview/#sdk-reference)
For CRUD operations, search, filtering, sorting, aggregation, and deletion, see the generated SDK reference:
**[Agent Data API Reference](https://developers.llamaindex.ai/reference/resources/beta/subresources/agent_data/)**
The reference covers all available operations:
  * **Create / Get / Update / Delete** individual records
  * **Search** with filtering, sorting, and pagination
  * **Aggregate** by grouping fields with counts and first-item retrieval
  * **Delete by query** for bulk deletion using the filter DSL


SDK packages:
  * **Python** : [`llama-cloud`](https://pypi.org/project/llama-cloud/) (`pip install 'llama-cloud>=1'`)
  * **JavaScript** : [`@llamaindex/llama-cloud`](https://www.npmjs.com/package/@llamaindex/llama-cloud) (`npm install @llamaindex/llama-cloud`)


### ExtractedData wrapper
[Section titled “ExtractedData wrapper”](https://developers.llamaindex.ai/python/llamaagents/cloud/agent-data-overview/#extracteddata-wrapper)
`ExtractedData` is a specialized wrapper type available in the Python SDK (`llama-cloud`) and the JavaScript UI library (`@llamaindex/ui`). It is not part of the generated API reference, so it is documented here.
`ExtractedData[T]` is designed for extraction workflows where data goes through review and approval stages. Use it as the type parameter when storing extraction results in Agent Data.
**Fields:**  
| Field  | Description  |  
| --- | --- |  
| `original_data`  | The data as originally extracted (preserved for change tracking)  |  
| `data`  | The current state of the data (updated by human review)  |  
| `status`  | Workflow status: `pending_review`, `accepted`, `rejected`, `error`, or custom string  |  
| `overall_confidence`  | Aggregated confidence score (auto-calculated from field_metadata)  |  
| `field_metadata`  | Dict mapping field paths to metadata including confidence scores and citations  |  
| `file_id`  | LlamaCloud file ID of the source document  |  
| `file_name`  | Name of the source file  |  
| `file_hash`  | Content hash for deduplication  |  
| `metadata`  | Additional application-specific metadata  |  
**Python usage:**

```


from pydantic import BaseModel




from llama_cloud.types.beta.extracted_data import ExtractedData





classInvoice(BaseModel):




vendor: str|None=None




total: float|None=None




date: str|None=None


```

Use the `client.beta.agent_data` resource to store `ExtractedData` records. The data is serialized as a JSON dict matching the `ExtractedData` shape.
**Creating from an extraction job:**
The `from_extract_job` factory method creates an `ExtractedData` instance directly from a completed `ExtractV2Job`, automatically capturing field metadata (confidence scores, citations):

```


from llama_cloud.types.beta.extracted_data import ExtractedData





extracted = ExtractedData.from_extract_job(




job=extract_job,




schema=Invoice,






await client.beta.agent_data.create(




data=extracted.model_dump(),




deployment_name=deployment_name,




collection="invoices",



```

**Creating manually:**
Use `ExtractedData.create` when constructing extracted data from other sources or transforming to a different schema:

```


from llama_cloud.types.beta.extracted_data import ExtractedData





invoice = Invoice(vendor="Acme Corp", total=1500.00, date="2024-01-15")





extracted = ExtractedData.create(




data=invoice,




status="pending_review",




file_id="file-abc123",




file_name="invoice.pdf",




file_hash="sha256:...",




field_metadata={




"vendor": {"confidence": 0.95, "citation": [{"page": 1, "matching_text": "Acme Corp"}]},




"total": {"confidence": 0.92},




```

**JavaScript / TypeScript usage:**
In `@llamaindex/ui`, `ExtractedData` is available as a TypeScript type for use in UI components that display extraction results with review workflows.
