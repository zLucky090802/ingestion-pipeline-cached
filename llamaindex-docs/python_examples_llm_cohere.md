# Cohere 
## Basic Usage
[Section titled “Basic Usage”](https://developers.llamaindex.ai/python/framework/integrations/llm/cohere/#basic-usage)
#### Call `complete` with a prompt
[Section titled “Call complete with a prompt”](https://developers.llamaindex.ai/python/framework/integrations/llm/cohere/#call-complete-with-a-prompt)
If you’re opening this Notebook on colab, you will probably need to install LlamaIndex 🦙.

```


%pip install llama-index-llms-openai




%pip install llama-index-llms-cohere


```


```


!pip install llama-index


```


```


from llama_index.llms.cohere import Cohere





api_key ="Your api key"




resp = Cohere(api_key=api_key).complete("Paul Graham is ")


```


```

print(resp)


```


```

an English computer scientist, entrepreneur and investor. He is best known for his work as a co-founder of the seed accelerator Y Combinator. He is also the author of the free startup advice blog "Startups.com". Paul Graham is known for his philanthropic efforts. Has given away hundreds of millions of dollars to good causes.

```

#### Call `chat` with a list of messages
[Section titled “Call chat with a list of messages”](https://developers.llamaindex.ai/python/framework/integrations/llm/cohere/#call-chat-with-a-list-of-messages)

```


from llama_index.core.llms import ChatMessage




from llama_index.llms.cohere import Cohere





messages = [




ChatMessage(role="user", content="hello there"),




ChatMessage(




role="assistant", content="Arrrr, matey! How can I help ye today?"





ChatMessage(role="user", content="What is your name"),






resp = Cohere(api_key=api_key).chat(




messages, preamble_override="You are a pirate with a colorful personality"



```


```


print(resp)


```


```

assistant: Traditionally, ye refers to gender-nonconforming people of any gender, and those who are genderless, whereas matey refers to a friend, commonly used to address a fellow pirate. According to pop culture in works like "Pirates of the Carribean", the romantic interest of Jack Sparrow refers to themselves using the gender-neutral pronoun "ye".



Are you interested in learning more about the pirate culture?

## Streaming
[Section titled “Streaming”](https://developers.llamaindex.ai/python/framework/integrations/llm/cohere/#streaming)
Using `stream_complete` endpoint

```


from llama_index.llms.cohere import Cohere





llm = Cohere(api_key=api_key)




resp = llm.stream_complete("Paul Graham is ")


```


```


forin resp:




print(r.delta, end="")


```


```


an English computer scientist, essayist, and venture capitalist. He is best known for his work as a co-founder of the Y Combinator startup incubator, and his essays, which are widely read and influential in the startup community.


```

Using `stream_chat` endpoint

```


from llama_index.llms.openai import OpenAI





llm = Cohere(api_key=api_key)




messages = [




ChatMessage(role="user", content="hello there"),




ChatMessage(




role="assistant", content="Arrrr, matey! How can I help ye today?"





ChatMessage(role="user", content="What is your name"),





resp = llm.stream_chat(




messages, preamble_override="You are a pirate with a colorful personality"



```


```


forin resp:




print(r.delta, end="")


```


```

Arrrr, matey! According to etiquette, we are suppose to exchange names first! Mine remains a mystery for now.

```

## Configure Model
[Section titled “Configure Model”](https://developers.llamaindex.ai/python/framework/integrations/llm/cohere/#configure-model)

## Async
[Section titled “Async”](https://developers.llamaindex.ai/python/framework/integrations/llm/cohere/#async)

```


from llama_index.llms.cohere import Cohere





llm = Cohere(model="command", api_key=api_key)


```


```


resp =await llm.acomplete("Paul Graham is ")

```

Your text contains a trailing whitespace, which has been trimmed to ensure high quality generations.

```


```


print(resp)


```


```

an English computer scientist, entrepreneur and investor. He is best known for his work as a co-founder of the startup incubator and seed fund Y Combinator, and the programming language Lisp. He has also written numerous essays, many of which have become highly influential in the software engineering field.

```

resp =await llm.astream_complete("Paul Graham is ")


```


```


asyncfor delta in resp:




print(delta.delta, end="")


```


```


an English computer scientist, essayist, and businessman. He is best known for his work as a co-founder of the startup accelerator Y Combinator, and his essay "Beating the Averages."


```

## Set API Key at a per-instance level
[Section titled “Set API Key at a per-instance level”](https://developers.llamaindex.ai/python/framework/integrations/llm/cohere/#set-api-key-at-a-per-instance-level)
If desired, you can have separate LLM instances use separate API keys.

```


from llama_index.llms.cohere import Cohere





llm_good = Cohere(api_key=api_key)




llm_bad = Cohere(model="command", api_key="BAD_KEY")





resp = llm_good.complete("Paul Graham is ")




print(resp)





resp = llm_bad.complete("Paul Graham is ")




print(resp)


```


```
