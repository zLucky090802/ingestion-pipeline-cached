# SQL Join Query Engine 
In this tutorial, we show you how to use our SQLJoinQueryEngine.
This query engine allows you to combine insights from your structured tables with your unstructured data. It first decides whether to query your structured tables for insights. Once it does, it can then infer a corresponding query to the vector store in order to fetch corresponding documents.
**NOTE:** Any Text-to-SQL application should be aware that executing arbitrary SQL queries can be a security risk. It is recommended to take precautions as needed, such as using restricted roles, read-only databases, sandboxing, etc.
### Setup
[Section titled “Setup”](https://developers.llamaindex.ai/python/examples/query_engine/sqljoinqueryengine/#setup)
If you’re opening this Notebook on colab, you will probably need to install LlamaIndex 🦙.

```


%pip install llama-index-readers-wikipedia




%pip install llama-index-llms-openai


```


```


!pip install llama-index


```


```


# NOTE: This is ONLY necessary in jupyter notebook.



# Details: Jupyter runs an event-loop behind the scenes.


#          This results in nested event-loops when we start an event-loop to make async queries.


#          This is normally not allowed, we use nest_asyncio to allow it for convenience.



import nest_asyncio




nest_asyncio.apply()




import logging




import sys





logging.basicConfig(stream=sys.stdout, level=logging.INFO)




logging.getLogger().addHandler(logging.StreamHandler(stream=sys.stdout))


```

### Create Common Objects
[Section titled “Create Common Objects”](https://developers.llamaindex.ai/python/examples/query_engine/sqljoinqueryengine/#create-common-objects)
This includes a `ServiceContext` object containing abstractions such as the LLM and chunk size. This also includes a `StorageContext` object containing our vector store abstractions.

```

# # define pinecone index


# import pinecone


# import os



# api_key = os.environ['PINECONE_API_KEY']


# pinecone.init(api_key=api_key, environment="us-west1-gcp")



# # dimensions are for text-embedding-ada-002


# # pinecone.create_index("quickstart", dimension=1536, metric="euclidean", pod_type="p1")


# pinecone_index = pinecone.Index("quickstart")

```


```

# # OPTIONAL: delete all


# pinecone_index.delete(deleteAll=True)

```

### Create Database Schema + Test Data
[Section titled “Create Database Schema + Test Data”](https://developers.llamaindex.ai/python/examples/query_engine/sqljoinqueryengine/#create-database-schema--test-data)
Here we introduce a toy scenario where there are 100 tables (too big to fit into the prompt)

```


from sqlalchemy import (




create_engine,




MetaData,




Table,




Column,




String,




Integer,




select,




column,



```


```


engine = create_engine("sqlite:///:memory:", future=True)




metadata_obj = MetaData()


```


```

# create city SQL table



table_name ="city_stats"




city_stats_table = Table(




table_name,




metadata_obj,




Column("city_name", String(16), primary_key=True),




Column("population", Integer),




Column("country", String(16), nullable=False),





metadata_obj.create_all(engine)

```


```

# print tables


metadata_obj.tables.keys()

```


```

dict_keys(['city_stats'])

```

We introduce some test data into the `city_stats` table

```


from sqlalchemy import insert





rows = [




{"city_name": "Toronto", "population": 2930000, "country": "Canada"},




{"city_name": "Tokyo", "population": 13960000, "country": "Japan"},




{"city_name": "Berlin", "population": 3645000, "country": "Germany"},





for row in rows:




stmt = insert(city_stats_table).values(**row)




with engine.begin() as connection:




cursor = connection.execute(stmt)


```


```


with engine.connect() as connection:




cursor = connection.exec_driver_sql("SELECT * FROM city_stats")




print(cursor.fetchall())


```


```

[('Toronto', 2930000, 'Canada'), ('Tokyo', 13960000, 'Japan'), ('Berlin', 3645000, 'Germany')]

```

### Load Data
[Section titled “Load Data”](https://developers.llamaindex.ai/python/examples/query_engine/sqljoinqueryengine/#load-data)
We first show how to convert a Document into a set of Nodes, and insert into a DocumentStore.

```
