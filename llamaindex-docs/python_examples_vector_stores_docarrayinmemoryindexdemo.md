# DocArray InMemory Vector Store 
[DocArrayInMemoryVectorStore](https://docs.docarray.org/user_guide/storing/index_in_memory/) is a document index provided by [Docarray](https://github.com/docarray/docarray) that stores documents in memory. It is a great starting point for small datasets, where you may not want to launch a database server.
If you’re opening this Notebook on colab, you will probably need to install LlamaIndex 🦙.

```


%pip install llama-index-vector-stores-docarray


```


```


!pip install llama-index

## Initialization and indexing
[Section titled “Initialization and indexing”](https://developers.llamaindex.ai/python/framework/integrations/vector_stores/docarrayinmemoryindexdemo/#initialization-and-indexing)

```


from llama_index.core import StorageContext






vector_store = DocArrayInMemoryVectorStore()




storage_context = StorageContext.from_defaults(vector_store=vector_store)




index = GPTVectorStoreIndex.from_documents(




documents, storage_context=storage_context



```

## Querying
[Section titled “Querying”](https://developers.llamaindex.ai/python/framework/integrations/vector_stores/docarrayinmemoryindexdemo/#querying)

```

# set Logging to DEBUG for more detailed outputs



query_engine = index.as_query_engine()




response = query_engine.query("What did the author do growing up?")




print(textwrap.fill(str(response), 100))


```


```

Token indices sequence length is longer than the specified maximum sequence length for this model (1830 > 1024). Running this sequence through the model will result in indexing errors





Growing up, the author wrote short stories, programmed on an IBM 1401, and nagged his father to buy



him a TRS-80 microcomputer. He wrote simple games, a program to predict how high his model rockets


would fly, and a word processor. He also studied philosophy in college, but switched to AI after


becoming bored with it. He then took art classes at Harvard and applied to art schools, eventually


attending RISD.

```


```


response = query_engine.query("What was a hard moment for the author?")




print(textwrap.fill(str(response), 100))


```


```


A hard moment for the author was when he realized that the AI programs of the time were a hoax and



that there was an unbridgeable gap between what they could do and actually understanding natural


language. He had invested a lot of time and energy into learning about AI and was disappointed to


find out that it was not going to get him the results he had hoped for.

## Querying with filters
[Section titled “Querying with filters”](https://developers.llamaindex.ai/python/framework/integrations/vector_stores/docarrayinmemoryindexdemo/#querying-with-filters)

text="The Shawshank Redemption",




metadata={




"author": "Stephen King",




"theme": "Friendship",






TextNode(




text="The Godfather",




metadata={




"director": "Francis Ford Coppola",




"theme": "Mafia",






TextNode(




text="Inception",




metadata={




"director": "Christopher Nolan",





```


```


from llama_index.core import StorageContext






vector_store = DocArrayInMemoryVectorStore()




storage_context = StorageContext.from_defaults(vector_store=vector_store)





index = GPTVectorStoreIndex(nodes, storage_context=storage_context)


```


```


from llama_index.core.vector_stores import ExactMatchFilter, MetadataFilters






filters = MetadataFilters(




filters=[ExactMatchFilter(key="theme", value="Mafia")]






retriever = index.as_retriever(filters=filters)




retriever.retrieve("What is inception about?")


```


```
