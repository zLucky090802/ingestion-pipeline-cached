# Pydantic Tree Summarize 
In this notebook, we demonstrate how to use tree summarize with structured outputs. Specifically, tree summarize is used to output pydantic objects.

```


import os




import openai





os.environ["OPENAI_API_KEY"] ="sk-..."




openai.api_key = os.environ["OPENAI_API_KEY"]

### Create pydantic model to structure response
[Section titled “Create pydantic model to structure response”](https://developers.llamaindex.ai/python/examples/response_synthesizers/pydantic_tree_summarize/#create-pydantic-model-to-structure-response)

```


classBiography(BaseModel):




"""Data model for a biography."""





name: str




best_known_for: List[str]




extra_info: str


```


```


summarizer = TreeSummarize(verbose=True, output_cls=Biography)


```


```


response = summarizer.get_response("who is Paul Graham?", [text])


```


```

5 text chunks after repacking


1 text chunks after repacking

```

### Inspect the response
[Section titled “Inspect the response”](https://developers.llamaindex.ai/python/examples/response_synthesizers/pydantic_tree_summarize/#inspect-the-response)
Here, we see the response is in an instance of our `Biography` class.

```


print(response)


```
