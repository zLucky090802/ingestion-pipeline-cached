# You.com Retriever 
This notebook demonstrates how to use You.com’s Search API as a retriever in LlamaIndex. The API automatically returns relevant web and/or news results based on your query. Visit our docs to learn more about our Search and other APIs: <https://docs.you.com/>
The retriever converts You.com’s search results into LlamaIndex’s standard format (`NodeWithScore`), allowing you to:
  * Use search results as context for LLM queries
  * Combine with other retrievers (vector stores, databases)
  * Integrate seamlessly with query engines and agents


Running cells with ‘.venv (Python 3.13.9)’ requires the `ipykernel` package. You may need to install it into your Python environment.
To get started, install the `llama-index-retrievers-you` package.

```


%pip install llama-index-retrievers-you


```

## Setup
[Section titled “Setup”](https://developers.llamaindex.ai/python/framework/integrations/retrievers/you_retriever/#setup)
Get your API key from the [You.com platform](https://you.com/platform)

```


import os




from getpass import getpass




# Set your API key



you_api_key = os.environ.get("YDC_API_KEY") or getpass(




"Enter your You.com API key: "



```

## Basic usage
[Section titled “Basic usage”](https://developers.llamaindex.ai/python/framework/integrations/retrievers/you_retriever/#basic-usage)
First, let’s set up the retriever and see what data it returns:

```


from llama_index.retrievers.you import YouRetriever





retriever = YouRetriever(api_key=you_api_key)




retrieved_results = retriever.retrieve("national parks in the US")





print(f"Retrieved {len(retrieved_results)} results")





for i, result inenumerate(retrieved_results):




print(f"\nResult {i+1}:")




print(f"  Text: {result.node.text}...")




print("Metadata:")




for key, value in result.node.metadata.items():




print(f{key}: {value}")


```


```

Text: The journal Science has named the growth of renewable energy as the 2025 scientific breakthrough of the year. The reasoning is based on renewable energy surpassing coal as a power source globally this year.



China's exports of renewable technology are also transforming the rest of the world. Europe is a long-standing customer, but countries in the Global South are now also buying solar panels, batteries, and wind turbines at a rapid pace. In Pakistan, imports of Chinese solar panels increased fivefold from 2022 to 2024 when the Ukraine war drove up natural gas prices. According to Lauri Myllyvirta, an analyst at the Centre for Research on Energy and Clean Air, the choice was simple for people who worried about how to keep the lights on in their homes.


Now the real driver is self-interest: lower cost and greater energy security. Hannah Ritchie, a data scientist at the University of Oxford, notes that the long-awaited decline of fossil fuels is now within sight thanks to renewable energy.

Text: Trump and his energy secretary, Chris Wright, often speak of American energy dominance, but they are crippling American firms’ ability to deploy and build the cheapest sources of electricity in the history of this planet, in favor of a combination of long-in-the-tooth arguments about fossil inevitability and long-shot bets on small modular nuclear reactors and, yes, fusion. Even among billionaires who don’t share Trump’s belief that climate change is a hoax, this latter affinity for far-out, breakthrough technologies has long been a hallmark of American climate investment and philanthropy.



And at the scale and pace that China is producing them, plenty of things stand to be swept away—including, quite possibly, the once seemingly intractable problems of energy poverty and fossil-fuel dependence. In 2024, the total installed electricity capacity of the planet—every coal, gas, hydro, and nuclear plant and all of the renewables—was about 10 terawatts.


Globally, the glut of solar has lowered the average cost of generating electricity to 4 cents a kilowatt hour—perhaps the cheapest form of energy ever. By now, major headlines have begun to catch on to the reality that China’s renewable energy revolution is one of the biggest stories in the world, while Donald Trump’s anti-renewable vision of American energy dominance is a backward sideshow by comparison.


At the start of 2025—in an attempt to rein in the renewables sector—Beijing announced that it would discontinue a long-standing policy that had effectively propped up renewable energy prices, pegging them to that of the “baseline” coal power in each province....

Text: Renewable energy (also called green energy) is energy made from renewable natural resources that are replenished on a human timescale. The most widely used renewable energy types are solar energy, wind power, and hydropower. Bioenergy and geothermal power are also significant in some countries.



Renewable energy installations can be large or small and are suited for both urban and rural areas. Renewable energy is often deployed together with further electrification. This has several benefits: electricity can move heat and vehicles efficiently and is clean at the point of consumption.


Renewable energy systems have rapidly become more efficient and cheaper over the past 30 years. A large majority of worldwide newly installed worldwide electricity capacity is now renewable. Renewable energy sources, such as solar and wind power, have seen significant cost reductions over the past decade, making them more competitive with traditional fossil fuels.


Power from the sun and wind accounted for most of this increase, growing from a combined 2% to 10%. Use of fossil energy shrank from 68% to 62%. In 2024, renewables accounted for over 30% of global electricity generation and are projected to reach over 45% by 2030....

Renewable energy reached a major milestone in the first quarter of 2011, when it contributed 11.7% of total national energy production (660 TWh), surpassing energy production from nuclear power (620 TWh) for the first time since 1997.


In his 2012 State of the Union address, President Barack Obama restated his commitment to renewable energy and mentioned the long-standing Interior Department commitment to permit 10 GW of renewable energy projects on public land in 2012. Under President Joe Biden, Congress increased that goal to 25 GW by 2025.


Renewable energy technologies encompass a broad, diverse array of technologies, including solar photovoltaics, solar thermal power plants and heating/cooling systems, wind farms, hydroelectricity, geothermal power plants, and ocean power systems and the use of biomass....

Text: Our Powering up for net zero article series explores how innovative technologies and solutions – such as smart grid technologies, distributed energy generation, energy storage, and energy parks – can work in tandem with the major grid infrastructure reinforcements underway to meet growing energy demands. See the other articles in this series so far: ... The transition to renewables has accelerated rapidly in the UK, with offshore wind, solar, and hydropower now a growing share of our energy mix.



Battery Energy Storage Systems (BESS) and long-duration storage technologies are an important link in a truly decarbonised energy system. They transform intermittent renewable generation into a dependable, 24/7 energy resource, bridging the gap between variable supply and constant demand.


By capturing excess energy and releasing it during peak hours, storage systems can reduce curtailment, cut carbon emissions, and lower system costs, helping the UK make better use of its clean energy resources. Renewable energy sources such as wind, solar, and hydropower are crucial for decarbonisation, but they are inherently variable.


But as these plants are phased out, the grid is becoming more exposed to the variability of renewable generation. The UK grid has already faced such pressures, and similar incidents across Europe highlight the importance of both energy storage and flexible generation....

Text: These technological developments have been reinforced by evolving blending mandates and renewable fuel policies in major markets, including Brazil, the European Union, and emerging aviation and marine fuel sectors. Collectively, these changes explain the surge in investment and capacity expansion observed globally and signal a transition of ethanol from a compliance fuel towards a strategically optimised, low-carbon energy carrier.



Recent advances in biofuel technology include improved enzymes, higher-yield crops and processes that use crop residues to boost yields. These developments, alongside renewable energy and carbon-reduction efforts, are strengthening collaboration in the sector.


Emerging trends and market effects - Laws mandating increased ethanol consumption More countries, economic groups, and states are opening their energy systems to biofuels. Brazil has approved a law increasing ethanol content in petrol from 27.5% to 35% [12]. Biodiesel is rising from 15% to 25%. The most significant change is in aviation, with a 1% blend starting in 2027, rising to 10% in 2037 and increasing by 1% annually thereafter. In Europe, the EU is finalising its ethanol blending policies, with a 2030 target of 5.5% renewable fuel [13]. In the US, there is no mandatory ethanol percentage, although financial regulations such as waivers influence consumer behaviour [14]. The transition from E10 to E15, along with expanded availability, further demonstrates growing demand.


One method for distilleries to offset their environmental footprint is through government carbon credits. These credits were once considered unattainable due to gas emissions. However, in 2024, the first ethanol plant voluntarily entered carbon markets [4]. Red Trail Energy laid the groundwork for future facilities....

Text: This is expected to be the year of accelerated growth in renewable energy adoption and investments globally, driven by falling costs, advancements in battery and storage technology, smart grids, increased finance, and favourable regulations in many countries around the world.



Renewable Energy Costs To Fall Further. Yes, the cost of investing in renewable energy projects will continue its downward trend this year. Notably, wind and solar power will go further lower as cost competitiveness remains the defining characteristic of renewable energy sources.


In 2024, for instance, 91 percent of all newly commissioned utility-scale renewable projects delivered electricity at a lower cost than the cheapest new fossil fuel-fired alternative, according to findings of a study by the International Renewable Energy Agency (IRENA).


At the heart of its increased adoption will be strong economics, technological advancements, and a push for energy security and sovereignty, especially in Africa, where 600 million people live in the dark and cold. In many parts of the world, new renewable energy projects are already cheaper than fossil fuel alternatives....

These results suggest that while renewable deployment may advance environmental and economic goals, its contribution to greater social equity is less evident, underscoring the importance of policies that explicitly integrate decarbonization with distributive justice and affordability. Future research should further explore the differentiated social impacts of renewable deployment across income groups, and household types, providing a stronger empirical basis for designing energy transitions that are not only sustainable but also just.


Limiting the global temperature increase to 1.5º C above pre-industrial levels, as outlined in the Paris Agreement (UNFCCC, 2015) requires a transition to climate-neural economy, driven by the rapid and deep decarbonization of the energy system, with renewable energy sources (RES) playing a pivotal role (IEA, 2022)....

## Using with Query Engine
[Section titled “Using with Query Engine”](https://developers.llamaindex.ai/python/framework/integrations/retrievers/you_retriever/#using-with-query-engine)
Now that we’ve seen how to customize the web data we want to retrieve, let’s use an LLM to synthesize natural language answers from the search results. In this example, we’ll use a model from Anthropic.

```


%pip install llama-index-llms-anthropic


```


```


import os




from getpass import getpass




# Set your Anthropic API key



anthropic_api_key = os.environ.get("ANTHROPIC_API_KEY") or getpass(




"Enter your Anthropic API key: "



```


```


from llama_index.core.query_engine import RetrieverQueryEngine




from llama_index.llms.anthropic import Anthropic




from llama_index.core import Settings




from llama_index.retrievers.you import YouRetriever




# Configure Anthropic as your LLM



llm = Anthropic(model="claude-haiku-4-5-20251001", api_key=anthropic_api_key)




# Create a query engine that uses You.com search results as context



retriever = YouRetriever(api_key=you_api_key)




query_engine = RetrieverQueryEngine.from_args(retriever, llm)


```


```

# The query engine:


# 1. Uses the retriever to fetch relevant search results from You.com


# 2. Passes those results as context to the LLM


# 3. Returns a synthesized answer




response = query_engine.query(




"What are the most visited national parks in the US and why? keep it brief."





# Try a different query


# response = query_engine.query("What are the latest geopolitical updates from India")




print(str(response))


```


```

# Most Visited National Parks in the US



**Top 3 Most Visited:**



1. **Great Smoky Mountains National Park** (North Carolina/Tennessee) - 13.3 million visitors



- Why: Gorgeous ancient mountains, diverse plant and animal life, historical Southern Appalachian culture, and home to American black bears and other wildlife




2. **Zion National Park** (Utah) - 4.9 million visitors



- Why: Striking vertical topography with red rock formations, sandstone canyons, and sharp cliffs




3. **Grand Canyon National Park** (Arizona) - 4.7 million visitors



- Why: Iconic mile-deep canyon with spectacular erosion examples and incomparable vistas from both rims




**Other Popular Parks:**


- **Yosemite National Park** (California) - Famous for towering granite cliffs, waterfalls, and giant sequoias


- **Glacier National Park** (Montana) - Mountain landscapes shaped by glacial forces



These parks attract millions of visitors annually due to their dramatic natural landscapes, diverse ecosystems, abundant wildlife, and extensive outdoor recreation opportunities like hiking, boating, and wildlife viewing.

```

## Why this format?
[Section titled “Why this format?”](https://developers.llamaindex.ai/python/framework/integrations/retrievers/you_retriever/#why-this-format)
The retriever converts You.com’s JSON response into LlamaIndex’s standard `NodeWithScore` format. This provides:
**Benefits:**
  * **Source-agnostic** : Same interface whether retrieving from You.com, vector DBs, or other sources
  * **Composability** : Easily combine multiple retrievers or swap them out
  * **Integration** : Works seamlessly with LlamaIndex query engines, agents, and other components


**What’s preserved:**
  * **Text content** : Snippets from web results or descriptions from news articles
  * **Metadata** : URL, title, page_age stored in the `metadata` dict
  * **Score** : Relevance score (1.0 by default since You.com doesn’t provide scores)


This abstraction lets you focus on building applications rather than handling API-specific response formats.
