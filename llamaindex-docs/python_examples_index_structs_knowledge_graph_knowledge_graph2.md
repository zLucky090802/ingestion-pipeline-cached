# Knowledge Graph Construction w/ WikiData Filtering 
In this notebook, we compare using [REBEL](https://huggingface.co/Babelscape/rebel-large) for knowledge graph construction with and without filtering from wikidata.
This is a simplified version, find out more about using wikipedia for filtering, check here

## 1. extract via huggingface pipeline
[Section titled “1. extract via huggingface pipeline”](https://developers.llamaindex.ai/python/examples/index_structs/knowledge_graph/knowledge_graph2/#1-extract-via-huggingface-pipeline)
The initial pipeline uses the provided extraction code from the [HuggingFace model card](https://huggingface.co/Babelscape/rebel-large).

```


from transformers import pipeline





triplet_extractor = pipeline(




"text2text-generation",




model="Babelscape/rebel-large",




tokenizer="Babelscape/rebel-large",




# comment this line to run on CPU




device="cuda:0",







defextract_triplets(input_text):




text = triplet_extractor.tokenizer.batch_decode(





triplet_extractor(




input_text, return_tensors=True, return_text=False




)[0]["generated_token_ids"]







triplets = []




relation, subject, relation, object_ ="", "", "", ""




text = text.strip()




current ="x"




for token in (




text.replace("<s>", "")




.replace("<pad>", "")




.replace("</s>", "")




.split()





if token =="<triplet>":




current ="t"




if relation !="":




triplets.append(




(subject.strip(), relation.strip(), object_.strip())





relation =""




subject =""




elif token =="<subj>":




current ="s"




if relation !="":




triplets.append(




(subject.strip(), relation.strip(), object_.strip())





object_ =""




elif token =="<obj>":




current ="o"




relation =""




else:

object_ +=" "+ token




elif current =="o":




relation +=" "+ token





if subject !=""and relation !=""and object_ !="":




triplets.append((subject.strip(), relation.strip(), object_.strip()))





return triplets


```

## 2. Extract with wiki filtering
[Section titled “2. Extract with wiki filtering”](https://developers.llamaindex.ai/python/examples/index_structs/knowledge_graph/knowledge_graph2/#2-extract-with-wiki-filtering)
Optionally, we can filter our extracted relations using data from wikipedia.

```


import wikipedia






classWikiFilter:




def__init__(self):




self.cache = {}





deffilter(self, candidate_entity):




# check the cache to avoid network calls




if candidate_entity inself.cache:




returnself.cache[candidate_entity]["title"]





# pull the page from wikipedia -- if it exists





page = wikipedia.page(candidate_entity, auto_suggest=False)




entity_data = {




"title": page.title,




"url": page.url,




"summary": page.summary,






# cache the page title and original entity




self.cache[candidate_entity] = entity_data




self.cache[page.title] = entity_data





return entity_data["title"]




except:




returnNone






wiki_filter = WikiFilter()






defextract_triplets_wiki(text):




relations = extract_triplets(text)





filtered_relations = []




for relation in relations:




(subj, rel, obj) = relation




filtered_subj = wiki_filter.filter(subj)




filtered_obj = wiki_filter.filter(obj)





# skip if at least one entity not linked to wiki




if filtered_subj isNoneand filtered_obj isNone:




continue





filtered_relations.append(





filtered_subj or subj,





filtered_obj or obj,







return filtered_relations
