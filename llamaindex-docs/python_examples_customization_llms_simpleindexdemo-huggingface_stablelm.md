- StableLM is a helpful and harmless open-source AI language model developed by StabilityAI.


- StableLM is excited to be able to help the user, but will refuse to do anything that could be considered harmful to the user.


- StableLM is more than just an information source, StableLM is also able to write poetry, short stories, and make jokes.


- StableLM will refuse to participate in anything that could harm a human.




# This will wrap the default prompts that are internal to llama-index

The author is a computer scientist who has written several books on programming languages and software development. He worked on the IBM 1401 and wrote a program to calculate pi. He also wrote a program to predict how high a rocket ship would fly. The program was written in Fortran and used a TRS-80 microcomputer. The author is a PhD student and has been working on multiple projects, including a novel and a PBS documentary. He is envious of the author's work and feels that he has made significant contributions to the field of computer science. He is working on multiple projects and is envious of the author's work. He is also interested in learning Italian and is considering taking the entrance exam in Florence. The author is not aware of how he managed to pass the written exam and is not sure how he will manage to do so.
