# Writing durable workflows
Workflows are ephemeral by default, meaning that once the `run()` method returns its result, the workflow state is lost. A subsequent call to `run()` on the same workflow instance will start from a fresh state.
If the use case requires to persist the workflow state across multiple runs and possibly different processes, there are a few strategies that can be used to make workflows more durable.
## Storing data in the workflow instance
[Section titled “Storing data in the workflow instance”](https://developers.llamaindex.ai/python/llamaagents/workflows/durable_workflows/#storing-data-in-the-workflow-instance)
Workflows are regular Python classes, and data can be stored in class or instance variables, so that subsequent `run()` invocations can access it.

```


classDbWorkflow(Workflow):




def__init__(self, db: Client, *args, **kwargs):




self.db = db




super().__init__(*args, **kwargs)





@step




defcount(self, ev: StartEvent) -> StopEvent:




num_rows =self.db.exec("select COUNT(*) from t;")




return StopEvent(result=num_rows)


```

In this case, multiple calls to `run()` will reuse the same database client.  
| Persists over `run` calls  | ✅  |  
| --- | --- |  
| Persists over process restarts  | ❌  |  
| Survives runtime errors  | ❌  |  
## Storing data in the context object
[Section titled “Storing data in the context object”](https://developers.llamaindex.ai/python/llamaagents/workflows/durable_workflows/#storing-data-in-the-context-object)
Each workflow comes with a special object responsible for its runtime operations called `Context`. The context instance is available to any step of a workflow and comes with a `store` property that can be used to store and load state data. Using the state store has two major advantages compared to class and instance variables:
  * It’s async safe and supports concurrent access
  * It can be serialized



```


w = MyWorkflow()




handler = w.run()




context = handler.ctx



# Save the context to a database



db.save("id", context.to_dict())





# Restart the Python process...





w = MyWorkflow()



# Load the context from the database



context = Context.from_dict(w, db.load("id"))



# Pass the context containing the state to the workflow



result =await w.run(ctx=context)


```
  
| Persists over `run` calls  | ✅  |  
| --- | --- |  
| Persists over process restarts  | ✅  |  
| Survives runtime errors  | ❌  |  
## Using external resources to checkpoint execution
[Section titled “Using external resources to checkpoint execution”](https://developers.llamaindex.ai/python/llamaagents/workflows/durable_workflows/#using-external-resources-to-checkpoint-execution)
To avoid any overhead, workflows don’t take snapshots of the current state automatically, so they can’t survive a fatal error on their own. However, any step can rely on some external database like Redis and snapshot the current context on sensitive parts of the code.
For example, given a long running workflow processing hundreds of documents, we could save the id of the last document successfully processed in the state store:

```


classDurableWorkflow(Workflow):




def__init__(self, r: Redis):




self.redis = r





@step




asyncdefconvert_documents(self, ev: StartEvent, ctx: Context) -> StopEvent:




# Get the workflow input




document_ids = ev.ids




# Get the list of processed documents from the state store




converted_ids =await ctx.store.get("converted_ids", default=[])




for doc_id in document_ids:




# Ignore documents that were alredy processed




if doc_id in converted_ids:




continue




convert()




# Update the state store




converted_ids.append(doc_id)




await ctx.store.set("converted_ids", converted_ids)




# Create a snapshot of the current context




self.redis.hset("ctx", mapping=ctx.to_dict())


```

The workflow will use a Redis collection to store a snapshot of the current context after every conversion. If the process running the workflow crashes, the process can be safely restarted with the same input. In fact, `ctx.store` will contain the list of documents already processed and the `for` loop will be able to skip them and continue to process the remaining work.
### Bonus: inject dependencies into the workflow to reduce boilerplate
[Section titled “Bonus: inject dependencies into the workflow to reduce boilerplate”](https://developers.llamaindex.ai/python/llamaagents/workflows/durable_workflows/#bonus-inject-dependencies-into-the-workflow-to-reduce-boilerplate)
Using the Resource feature of workflows, the Redis client can be injected into the step directly:

```


defget_redis_client(*args, **kwargs):




"""This can be reused across several workflows to reduce boilerplate"""




return Redis(host='localhost', port=6379, decode_responses=True)






classDurableWorkflow(Workflow):




@step




asyncdefconvert_documents(




self,




ev: StartEvent,




ctx: Context,




redis: Annotated[Redis, Resource(get_redis_client)]




) -> StopEvent:




# Get the workflow input




document_ids = ev.ids




# Get the list of processed documents from the state store




converted_ids =await ctx.store.get("converted_ids", default=[])




for doc_id in document_ids:




# Ignore documents that were alredy processed




if doc_id in converted_ids:




continue




convert()




# Update the state store




converted_ids.append(doc_id)




await ctx.store.set("converted_ids", converted_ids)




# Create a snapshot of the current context




redis.hset("ctx", mapping=ctx.to_dict())


```
