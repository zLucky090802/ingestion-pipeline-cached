# Perplexity 
Perplexity’s Sonar API offers a solution that combines real-time, grounded web search with advanced reasoning and deep research capabilities.
When to use:
  * When your application requires timely, relevant data directly from the web, such as dynamic content updates or current event tracking.
  * For products that need to support complex user queries with integrated reasoning and deep research, like digital assistants or advanced search engines.


Before we get started, make sure you install `llama_index`

```


%pip install llama-index-llms-perplexity


```


```


!pip install llama-index


```

## Initial Setup
[Section titled “Initial Setup”](https://developers.llamaindex.ai/python/framework/integrations/llm/perplexity/#initial-setup)
As of April 12th, 2025 - the following models are supported with the Perplexity LLM class in LLaMa Index:  
| Model  | Context Length  | Model Type  |  
| --- | --- | --- |  
| `sonar-deep-research`  | 128k  | Chat Completion  |  
| `sonar-reasoning-pro`  | 128k  | Chat Completion  |  
| `sonar-reasoning`  | 128k  | Chat Completion  |  
| `sonar-pro`  | 200k  | Chat Completion  |  
| `sonar`  | 128k  | Chat Completion  |  
| `r1-1776`  | 128k  | Chat Completion  |  
  * `sonar-pro` has a max output token limit of 8k.
  * The reasoning models output Chain of Thought responses.
  * `r1-1776` is an offline chat model that does not use the Perplexity search subsystem.


You can find the latest supported models [here](https://docs.perplexity.ai/docs/model-cards) Rate limits are found [here](https://docs.perplexity.ai/docs/rate-limits) Pricing can be found [here](https://docs.perplexity.ai/guides/pricing).

# Import the ChatMessage class from the llama_index library.



from llama_index.core.llms import ChatMessage




# Create a list of dictionaries where each dictionary represents a chat message.


# Each dictionary contains a 'role' key (e.g., system or user) and a 'content' key with the corresponding message.



messages_dict = [




{"role": "system", "content": "Be precise and concise."},





"role": "user",




"content": "Tell me the latest news about the US Stock Market.",






# Convert each dictionary in the list to a ChatMessage object using unpacking (**msg) in a list comprehension.



messages = [ChatMessage(**msg) for msg in messages_dict]




# Print the list of ChatMessage objects to verify the conversion.



print(messages)


```


```

[ChatMessage(role=<MessageRole.SYSTEM: 'system'>, additional_kwargs={}, blocks=[TextBlock(block_type='text', text='Be precise and concise.')]), ChatMessage(role=<MessageRole.USER: 'user'>, additional_kwargs={}, blocks=[TextBlock(block_type='text', text='Tell me the latest news about the US Stock Market.')])]

```

## Chat
[Section titled “Chat”](https://developers.llamaindex.ai/python/framework/integrations/llm/perplexity/#chat)

```


response = llm.chat(messages)




print(response)


```


```

assistant: The latest update on the U.S. stock market indicates a strong performance recently. A significant 10% rally occurred on Wednesday, which contributed substantially to market gains. Additionally, the market closed strongly on Friday, with a 2% increase, ending near the intraday high. This reflects robust momentum, particularly in mega and large-cap growth stocks[1].

```

## Async Chat
[Section titled “Async Chat”](https://developers.llamaindex.ai/python/framework/integrations/llm/perplexity/#async-chat)
For asynchronous conversation processing, use the `achat` method to send messages and await the response:

```

# Asynchronously send the list of chat messages to the LLM using the 'achat' method.


# This method returns a ChatResponse object containing the model's answer.



response =await llm.achat(messages)





print(response)


```


```

assistant: The U.S. stock market has recently experienced significant gains. A major rally on Wednesday resulted in a 10% surge, contributing substantially to the market's overall upside. Additionally, the market closed strongly on Friday, with a 2% increase, ending near the intraday high. This performance highlights robust momentum, particularly in mega-cap and large-cap growth stocks[1].

```

## Stream Chat
[Section titled “Stream Chat”](https://developers.llamaindex.ai/python/framework/integrations/llm/perplexity/#stream-chat)
For cases where you want to receive a response token by token in real time, use the `stream_chat` method:

```

# Call the stream_chat method on the LLM instance, which returns a generator or iterable


# for streaming the chat response one delta (token or chunk) at a time.



response = llm.stream_chat(messages)




# Iterate over each streaming response chunk.



forin response:




# Print the delta (the new chunk of generated text) without adding a newline.




print(r.delta, end="")


```


```

The latest news about the U.S. stock market indicates a strong performance recently. The New York Stock Exchange (NYSE) experienced a significant rally, with a 10% surge on Wednesday, followed by a 2% gain on Friday. This upward momentum brought the market near its intraday high, driven by strength in mega-cap and large-cap growth stocks[1].

```

## Async Stream Chat
[Section titled “Async Stream Chat”](https://developers.llamaindex.ai/python/framework/integrations/llm/perplexity/#async-stream-chat)
Similarly, for asynchronous streaming, the `astream_chat` method provides a way to process response deltas asynchronously:

```

# Asynchronously call the astream_chat method on the LLM instance,


# which returns an asynchronous generator that yields response chunks.



resp =await llm.astream_chat(messages)




# Asynchronously iterate over each response chunk from the generator.


# For each chunk (delta), print the chunk's text content.



asyncfor delta in resp:




print(delta.delta, end="")


```


```

The latest updates on the U.S. stock market indicate significant positive momentum. The New York Stock Exchange (NYSE) experienced a strong rally, with a notable 10% surge on Wednesday. This was followed by a 2% gain on Friday, closing near the intraday high. The market's performance has been driven by mega and large-cap growth stocks, contributing to the overall upside[1].

### Tool calling
[Section titled “Tool calling”](https://developers.llamaindex.ai/python/framework/integrations/llm/perplexity/#tool-calling)
Perplexity models can easily be wrapped into a llamaindex tool so that it can be called as part of your data processing or conversational workflows. This tool uses real-time generative search powered by Perplexity, and it’s configured with the updated default model (“sonar-pro”) and the enable_search_classifier parameter enabled.
Below is an example of how to define and register the tool:

```


from llama_index.core.tools import FunctionTool




from llama_index.llms.perplexity import Perplexity




from llama_index.core.llms import ChatMessage






defquery_perplexity(query: str) -> str:





Queries the Perplexity API via the LlamaIndex integration.





This function instantiates a Perplexity LLM with updated default settings




(using model "sonar-pro" and enabling search classifier so that the API can




intelligently decide if a search is needed), wraps the query into a ChatMessage,




and returns the generated response content.





pplx_api_key = (




"your-perplexity-api-key"# Replace with your actual API key






llm = Perplexity(




api_key=pplx_api_key,




model="sonar-pro",




temperature=0.7,




enable_search_classifier=True# This will determine if the search component is necessary in this particular context






messages = [ChatMessage(role="user", content=query)]




response = llm.chat(messages)




return response.message.content





# Create the tool from the query_perplexity function



query_perplexity_tool = FunctionTool.from_defaults(fn=query_perplexity)
