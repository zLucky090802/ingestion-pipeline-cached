# Redis Vector Store 
In this notebook we are going to show a quick demo of using the RedisVectorStore.
If you’re opening this Notebook on colab, you will probably need to install LlamaIndex 🦙.

```


%pip install -U llama-index llama-index-vector-stores-redis llama-index-embeddings-cohere llama-index-embeddings-openai


```


```


import os




import getpass




import sys




import logging




import textwrap




import warnings





warnings.filterwarnings("ignore")




# Uncomment to see debug logs



logging.basicConfig(stream=sys.stdout, level=logging.INFO)





from llama_index.core import VectorStoreIndex, SimpleDirectoryReader




from llama_index.vector_stores.redis import RedisVectorStore


```

### Start Redis
[Section titled “Start Redis”](https://developers.llamaindex.ai/python/framework/integrations/vector_stores/redisindexdemo/#start-redis)
The easiest way to start Redis is using the [Redis Stack](https://hub.docker.com/r/redis/redis-stack) docker image or quickly signing up for a [FREE Redis Cloud](https://redis.com/try-free) instance.
To follow every step of this tutorial, launch the image as follows:
Terminal window
```


dockerrun--nameredis-vecdb-d-p6379:6379-p8001:8001redis/redis-stack:latest


```

This will also launch the RedisInsight UI on port 8001 which you can view at <http://localhost:8001>.
### Setup OpenAI
[Section titled “Setup OpenAI”](https://developers.llamaindex.ai/python/framework/integrations/vector_stores/redisindexdemo/#setup-openai)
Lets first begin by adding the openai api key. This will allow us to access openai for embeddings and to use chatgpt.

```


oai_api_key = getpass.getpass("OpenAI API Key:")




os.environ["OPENAI_API_KEY"] = oai_api_key


```

Download Data

```


!mkdir -p 'data/paul_graham/'




!wget 'https://raw.githubusercontent.com/run-llama/llama_index/main/docs/examples/data/paul_graham/paul_graham_essay.txt'-O 'data/paul_graham/paul_graham_essay.txt'

### Read in a dataset
[Section titled “Read in a dataset”](https://developers.llamaindex.ai/python/framework/integrations/vector_stores/redisindexdemo/#read-in-a-dataset)
Here we will use a set of Paul Graham essays to provide the text to turn into embeddings, store in a `RedisVectorStore` and query to find context for our LLM QnA loop.

```

# load documents



documents = SimpleDirectoryReader("./data/paul_graham").load_data()




print(




"Document ID:",




documents[0].id_,




"Document Filename:",




documents[0].metadata["file_name"],



```


```

Document ID: 7056f7ba-3513-4ef4-9792-2bd28040aaed Document Filename: paul_graham_essay.txt

```

### Initialize the default Redis Vector Store
[Section titled “Initialize the default Redis Vector Store”](https://developers.llamaindex.ai/python/framework/integrations/vector_stores/redisindexdemo/#initialize-the-default-redis-vector-store)
Now we have our documents prepared, we can initialize the Redis Vector Store with **default** settings. This will allow us to store our vectors in Redis and create an index for real-time search.

```


from llama_index.core import StorageContext




from redis import Redis




# create a Redis client connection



redis_client = Redis.from_url("redis://localhost:6379")




# create the vector store wrapper



vector_store = RedisVectorStore(redis_client=redis_client, overwrite=True)




# load storage context



storage_context = StorageContext.from_defaults(vector_store=vector_store)




# build and load index from documents and storage context



index = VectorStoreIndex.from_documents(




documents, storage_context=storage_context




# index = VectorStoreIndex.from_vector_store(vector_store=vector_store)

```


```

```

### Query the default vector store
[Section titled “Query the default vector store”](https://developers.llamaindex.ai/python/framework/integrations/vector_stores/redisindexdemo/#query-the-default-vector-store)
Now that we have our data stored in the index, we can ask questions against the index.
The index will use the data as the knowledge base for an LLM. The default setting for as_query_engine() utilizes OpenAI embeddings and GPT as the language model. Therefore, an OpenAI key is required unless you opt for a customized or local language model.
Below we will test searches against out index and then full RAG with an LLM.

```


query_engine = index.as_query_engine()




retriever = index.as_retriever()


```


```


result_nodes = retriever.retrieve("What did the author learn?")




for node in result_nodes:

### Use a custom index schema
[Section titled “Use a custom index schema”](https://developers.llamaindex.ai/python/framework/integrations/vector_stores/redisindexdemo/#use-a-custom-index-schema)
In most use cases, you need the ability to customize the underling index configuration and specification. For example, this is handy in order to define specific metadata filters you wish to enable.
With Redis, this is as simple as defining an index schema object (from file or dict) and passing it through to the vector store client wrapper.
For this example, we will:
  1. switch the embedding model to [Cohere](https://developers.llamaindex.ai/python/framework/integrations/vector_stores/redisindexdemo/cohereai.com)
  2. add an additional metadata field for the document `updated_at` timestamp
  3. index the existing `file_name` metadata field



```


from llama_index.core.settings import Settings




from llama_index.embeddings.cohere import CohereEmbedding




# set up Cohere Key



co_api_key = getpass.getpass("Cohere API Key:")




os.environ["CO_API_KEY"] = co_api_key




# set llamaindex to use Cohere embeddings



Settings.embed_model = CohereEmbedding()


```


```


from redisvl.schema import IndexSchema






custom_schema = IndexSchema.from_dict(





# customize basic index specs




"index": {




"name": "paul_graham",




"prefix": "essay",




"key_separator": ":",





# customize fields that are indexed

### Restoring from an existing index in Redis
[Section titled “Restoring from an existing index in Redis”](https://developers.llamaindex.ai/python/framework/integrations/vector_stores/redisindexdemo/#restoring-from-an-existing-index-in-redis)
Restoring from an index requires a Redis connection client (or URL), `overwrite=False`, and passing in the same schema object used before. (This can be offloaded to a YAML file for convenience using `.to_yaml()`)

```


custom_schema.to_yaml("paul_graham.yaml")


```


```


vector_store = RedisVectorStore(




schema=IndexSchema.from_yaml("paul_graham.yaml"),




redis_client=redis_client,





index = VectorStoreIndex.from_vector_store(vector_store=vector_store)


```


```

19:40:28 redisvl.index.index INFO   Index already exists, not overwriting.

```

**In the near future** — we will implement a convenience method to load just using an index name:

```


RedisVectorStore.from_existing_index(index_name="paul_graham", redis_client=redis_client)


```

### Deleting documents or index completely
[Section titled “Deleting documents or index completely”](https://developers.llamaindex.ai/python/framework/integrations/vector_stores/redisindexdemo/#deleting-documents-or-index-completely)
Sometimes it may be useful to delete documents or the entire index. This can be done using the `delete` and `delete_index` methods.

```


document_id = documents[0].doc_id



document_id

```


```

'7056f7ba-3513-4ef4-9792-2bd28040aaed'

```


```


print("Number of documents before deleting", redis_client.dbsize())



vector_store.delete(document_id)



print("Number of documents after deleting", redis_client.dbsize())


```


```

Number of documents before deleting 22


19:40:32 llama_index.vector_stores.redis.base INFO   Deleted 22 documents from index paul_graham


Number of documents after deleting 0

```

However, the Redis index still exists (with no associated documents) for continuous upsert.

```

vector_store.index_exists()

```


```

# now lets delete the index entirely


# this will delete all the documents and the index


vector_store.delete_index()

```


```

19:40:37 llama_index.vector_stores.redis.base INFO   Deleting index paul_graham

```


```


print("Number of documents after deleting", redis_client.dbsize())


```


```

```

### Troubleshooting
[Section titled “Troubleshooting”](https://developers.llamaindex.ai/python/framework/integrations/vector_stores/redisindexdemo/#troubleshooting)
If you get an empty query result, there a couple of issues to check:
#### Schema
[Section titled “Schema”](https://developers.llamaindex.ai/python/framework/integrations/vector_stores/redisindexdemo/#schema)
Unlike other vector stores, Redis expects users to explicitly define the schema for the index. This is for a few reasons:
  1. Redis is used for many use cases, including real-time vector search, but also for standard document storage/retrieval, caching, messaging, pub/sub, session mangement, and more. Not all attributes on records need to be indexed for search. This is partially an efficiency thing, and partially an attempt to minimize user foot guns.
  2. All index schemas, when using Redis & LlamaIndex, must include the following fields `id`, `doc_id`, `text`, and `vector`, at a minimum.


Instantiate your `RedisVectorStore` with the default schema (assumes OpenAI embeddings), or with a custom schema (see above).
#### Prefix issues
[Section titled “Prefix issues”](https://developers.llamaindex.ai/python/framework/integrations/vector_stores/redisindexdemo/#prefix-issues)
Redis expects all records to have a key prefix that segments the keyspace into “partitions” for potentially different applications, use cases, and clients.
Make sure that the chosen `prefix`, as part of the index schema, is consistent across your code (tied to a specific index).
To see what prefix your index was created with, you can run `FT.INFO <name of your index>` in the Redis CLI and look under `index_definition` => `prefixes`.
#### Data vs Index
[Section titled “Data vs Index”](https://developers.llamaindex.ai/python/framework/integrations/vector_stores/redisindexdemo/#data-vs-index)
Redis treats the records in the dataset and the index as different entities. This allows you more flexibility in performing updates, upserts, and index schema migrations.
If you have an existing index and want to make sure it’s dropped, you can run `FT.DROPINDEX <name of your index>` in the Redis CLI. Note that this will _not_ drop your actual data unless you pass `DD`
#### Empty queries when using metadata
[Section titled “Empty queries when using metadata”](https://developers.llamaindex.ai/python/framework/integrations/vector_stores/redisindexdemo/#empty-queries-when-using-metadata)
If you add metadata to the index _after_ it has already been created and then try to query over that metadata, your queries will come back empty.
Redis indexes fields upon index creation only (similar to how it indexes the prefixes, above).
