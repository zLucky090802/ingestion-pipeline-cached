# ReActAgent - A Simple Intro with Calculator Tools 
This is a notebook that showcases the ReAct agent over very simple calculator tools (no fancy RAG pipelines or API calls).
We show how it can reason step-by-step over different tools to achieve the end goal.
The main advantage of the ReAct agent over a Function Calling agent is that it can work with any LLM regardless of whether it supports function calling.
If you’re opening this Notebook on colab, you will probably need to install LlamaIndex 🦙.

```


%pip install llama-index


```


```


import os





os.environ["OPENAI_API_KEY"] ="sk-..."


```

## Define Function Tools
[Section titled “Define Function Tools”](https://developers.llamaindex.ai/python/examples/agent/react_agent/#define-function-tools)
We setup some trivial `multiply` and `add` tools. Note that you can define arbitrary functions and pass it to the `FunctionTool` (which will process the docstring and parameter signature).

```


defmultiply(a: int, b: int) -> int:




"""Multiply two integers and returns the result integer"""




return* b






defadd(a: int, b: int) -> int:




"""Add two integers and returns the result integer"""




return+ b


```

## Run Some Queries
[Section titled “Run Some Queries”](https://developers.llamaindex.ai/python/examples/agent/react_agent/#run-some-queries)

```


from llama_index.llms.openai import OpenAI




from llama_index.core.agent.workflow import ReActAgent




from llama_index.core.workflow import Context





llm = OpenAI(model="gpt-4o-mini")




agent = ReActAgent(tools=[multiply, add], llm=llm)




# Create a context to store the conversation history/session state



ctx = Context(agent)


```

## Run Some Example Queries
[Section titled “Run Some Example Queries”](https://developers.llamaindex.ai/python/examples/agent/react_agent/#run-some-example-queries)
By streaming the result, we can see the full response, including the thought process and tool calls.
If we wanted to stream only the result, we can buffer the stream and start streaming once `Answer:` is in the response.

```


from llama_index.core.agent.workflow import AgentStream, ToolCallResult





handler = agent.run("What is 20+(2*4)?", ctx=ctx)





asyncfor ev in handler.stream_events():




# if isinstance(ev, ToolCallResult):




#     print(f"\nCall {ev.tool_name} with {ev.tool_kwargs}\nReturned: {ev.tool_output}")




ifisinstance(ev, AgentStream):




print(f"{ev.delta}", end="", flush=True)





response =await handler


```


```

Thought: The current language of the user is: English. I need to use a tool to help me answer the question.


Action: multiply


Action Input: {"a": 2, "b": 4}Thought: Now I have the result of the multiplication, which is 8. I will add this to 20 to complete the calculation.


Action: add


Action Input: {'a': 20, 'b': 8}Thought: I can answer without using any more tools. I'll use the user's language to answer.


Answer: The result of 20 + (2 * 4) is 28.

```


```


print(str(response))


```


```

The result of 20 + (2 * 4) is 28.

```


```


print(response.tool_calls)


```


```

[ToolCallResult(tool_name='multiply', tool_kwargs={'a': 2, 'b': 4}, tool_id='a394d807-a9b7-42e0-8bff-f47a432d1530', tool_output=ToolOutput(content='8', tool_name='multiply', raw_input={'args': (), 'kwargs': {'a': 2, 'b': 4}}, raw_output=8, is_error=False), return_direct=False), ToolCallResult(tool_name='add', tool_kwargs={'a': 20, 'b': 8}, tool_id='784ccd85-ae9a-4184-9613-3696742064c7', tool_output=ToolOutput(content='28', tool_name='add', raw_input={'args': (), 'kwargs': {'a': 20, 'b': 8}}, raw_output=28, is_error=False), return_direct=False)]

```

## View Prompts
[Section titled “View Prompts”](https://developers.llamaindex.ai/python/examples/agent/react_agent/#view-prompts)
Let’s take a look at the core system prompt powering the ReAct agent!
Within the agent, the current conversation history is dumped below this line.

```


prompt_dict = agent.get_prompts()




for k, v in prompt_dict.items():




print(f"Prompt: {k}\n\nValue: {v.template}")


```


```

Prompt: react_header



Value: You are designed to help with a variety of tasks, from answering questions to providing summaries to other types of analyses.



## Tools



You have access to a wide variety of tools. You are responsible for using the tools in any sequence you deem appropriate to complete the task at hand.


This may require breaking the task into subtasks and using different tools to complete each subtask.



You have access to the following tools:


{tool_desc}




## Output Format



Please answer in the same language as the question and use the following format:




Thought: The current language of the user is: (user's language). I need to use a tool to help me answer the question.


Action: tool name (one of {tool_names}) if using a tool.


Action Input: the input to the tool, in a JSON format representing the kwargs (e.g. {{"input": "hello world", "num_beams": 5}})




Please ALWAYS start with a Thought.



NEVER surround your response with markdown code markers. You may use code markers within your response if you need to.



Please use a valid JSON format for the Action Input. Do NOT do this {{'input': 'hello world', 'num_beams': 5}}.



If this format is used, the tool will respond in the following format:




Observation: tool response




You should keep repeating the above format till you have enough information to answer the question without using any more tools. At that point, you MUST respond in one of the following two formats:




Thought: I can answer without using any more tools. I'll use the user's language to answer


Answer: [your answer here (In the same language as the user's question)]





Thought: I cannot answer the question with the provided tools.


Answer: [your answer here (In the same language as the user's question)]




## Current Conversation



Below is the current conversation consisting of interleaving human and assistant messages.

### Customizing the Prompt
[Section titled “Customizing the Prompt”](https://developers.llamaindex.ai/python/examples/agent/react_agent/#customizing-the-prompt)
For fun, let’s try instructing the agent to output the answer along with reasoning in bullet points. See ”## Additional Rules” section.

```


from llama_index.core import PromptTemplate





react_system_header_str ="""\





You are designed to help with a variety of tasks, from answering questions \




to providing summaries to other types of analyses.




## Tools


You have access to a wide variety of tools. You are responsible for using


the tools in any sequence you deem appropriate to complete the task at hand.


This may require breaking the task into subtasks and using different tools


to complete each subtask.



You have access to the following tools:


{tool_desc}



## Output Format


To answer the question, please use the following format.

```

Thought: I need to use a tool to help me answer the question. Action: tool name (one of {tool_names}) if using a tool. Action Input: the input to the tool, in a JSON format representing the kwargs (e.g. {{“input”: “hello world”, “num_beams”: 5}})

```

Please ALWAYS start with a Thought.



Please use a valid JSON format for the Action Input. Do NOT do this {{'input': 'hello world', 'num_beams': 5}}.



If this format is used, the user will respond in the following format:

```

Observation: tool response

```

You should keep repeating the above format until you have enough information


to answer the question without using any more tools. At that point, you MUST respond


in the one of the following two formats:

```

Thought: I can answer without using any more tools. Answer: [your answer here]
Thought: I cannot answer the question with the provided tools. Answer: Sorry, I cannot answer your query.

```

## Additional Rules


- The answer MUST contain a sequence of bullet points that explain how you arrived at the answer. This can include aspects of the previous conversation history.


- You MUST obey the function signature of each tool. Do NOT pass in no arguments if the function expects arguments.
