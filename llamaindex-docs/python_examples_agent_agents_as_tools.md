# Multi-Agent Report Generation using Agents as Tools 
In this notebook, we will explore how to create a multi-agent system that uses a top-level agent to orchestrate a group of agents as tools. Specifically, we will create a system that can research, write, and review a report on a given topic.
This notebook will assume that you have already either read the [basic agent workflow notebook](https://docs.llamaindex.ai/en/stable/examples/agent/agent_workflow_basic) or the [general agent documentation](https://docs.llamaindex.ai/en/stable/understanding/agent/).
## Setup
[Section titled “Setup”](https://developers.llamaindex.ai/python/examples/agent/agents_as_tools/#setup)
In this example, we will use `OpenAI` as our LLM. For all LLMs, check out the [examples documentation](https://docs.llamaindex.ai/en/stable/examples/llm/openai/) or [LlamaHub](https://llamahub.ai/?tab=llms) for a list of all supported LLMs and how to install/use them.
If we wanted, each agent could have a different LLM, but for this example, we will use the same LLM for all agents.

```


%pip install llama-index


```


```


from llama_index.llms.openai import OpenAI





sub_agent_llm = OpenAI(model="gpt-4.1-mini", api_key="sk-...")




orchestrator_llm = OpenAI(model="o3-mini", api_key="sk-...")


```

## System Design
[Section titled “System Design”](https://developers.llamaindex.ai/python/examples/agent/agents_as_tools/#system-design)
Our system will have three agents:
  1. A `ResearchAgent` that will search the web for information on the given topic.
  2. A `WriteAgent` that will write the report using the information found by the `ResearchAgent`.
  3. A `ReviewAgent` that will review the report and provide feedback.


We will then use a top-level agent to orchestrate the other agents to write our report.
While there are many ways to implement this system, in this case, we will use a single `web_search` tool to search the web for information on the given topic.

```


%pip install tavily-python


```


```


from tavily import AsyncTavilyClient






asyncdefsearch_web(query: str) -> str:




"""Useful for using the web to answer questions."""




client = AsyncTavilyClient(api_key="tvly-...")




returnstr(await client.search(query))


```

With our tool defined, we can now create our sub-agents.
If the LLM you are using supports tool calling, you can use the `FunctionAgent` class. Otherwise, you can use the `ReActAgent` class.

```


from llama_index.core.agent.workflow import FunctionAgent, ReActAgent





research_agent = FunctionAgent(




system_prompt=(




"You are the ResearchAgent that can search the web for information on a given topic and record notes on the topic. "




"You should output notes on the topic in a structured format."





llm=sub_agent_llm,




tools=[search_web],






write_agent = FunctionAgent(




system_prompt=(




"You are the WriteAgent that can write a report on a given topic. "




"Your report should be in a markdown format. The content should be grounded in the research notes. "




"Return your markdown report surrounded by <report>...</report> tags."





llm=sub_agent_llm,




tools=[],






review_agent = FunctionAgent(




system_prompt=(




"You are the ReviewAgent that can review the write report and provide feedback. "




"Your review should either approve the current report or request changes to be implemented."





llm=sub_agent_llm,




tools=[],



```

With our sub-agents defined, we can then convert them into tools that can be used by the top-level agent.

```


import re




from llama_index.core.workflow import Context






asyncdefcall_research_agent(ctx: Context, prompt: str) -> str:




"""Useful for recording research notes based on a specific prompt."""




result =await research_agent.run(




user_msg=f"Write some notes about the following: {prompt}"






asyncwith ctx.store.edit_state() as ctx_state:




ctx_state["state"]["research_notes"].append(str(result))





returnstr(result)






asyncdefcall_write_agent(ctx: Context) -> str:




"""Useful for writing a report based on the research notes or revising the report based on feedback."""




asyncwith ctx.store.edit_state() as ctx_state:




notes = ctx_state["state"].get("research_notes", None)




ifnot notes:




return"No research notes to write from."





user_msg =f"Write a markdown report from the following notes. Be sure to output the report in the following format: <report>...</report>:\n\n"





# Add the feedback to the user message if it exists




feedback = ctx_state["state"].get("review", None)




if feedback:




user_msg +=f"<feedback>{feedback}</feedback>\n\n"





# Add the research notes to the user message




notes ="\n\n".join(notes)




user_msg +=f"<research_notes>{notes}</research_notes>\n\n"





# Run the write agent




result =await write_agent.run(user_msg=user_msg)




report = re.search(




r"<report>(.*)</report>", str(result), re.DOTALL




).group(1)




ctx_state["state"]["report_content"] =str(report)





returnstr(report)






asyncdefcall_review_agent(ctx: Context) -> str:




"""Useful for reviewing the report and providing feedback."""




asyncwith ctx.store.edit_state() as ctx_state:




report = ctx_state["state"].get("report_content", None)




ifnot report:




return"No report content to review."





result =await review_agent.run(




user_msg=f"Review the following report: {report}"





ctx_state["state"]["review"] = result





return result


```

## Creating the Top-Level Orchestrator Agent
[Section titled “Creating the Top-Level Orchestrator Agent”](https://developers.llamaindex.ai/python/examples/agent/agents_as_tools/#creating-the-top-level-orchestrator-agent)
With our sub-agents defined as tools, we can now create our top-level orchestrator agent.

```


orchestrator = FunctionAgent(




system_prompt=(




"You are an expert in the field of report writing. "




"You are given a user request and a list of tools that can help with the request. "




"You are to orchestrate the tools to research, write, and review a report on the given topic. "




"Once the review is positive, you should notify the user that the report is ready to be accessed."





llm=orchestrator_llm,




tools=[




call_research_agent,




call_write_agent,




call_review_agent,





initial_state={




"research_notes": [],




"report_content": None,




"review": None,




```

## Running the Agent
[Section titled “Running the Agent”](https://developers.llamaindex.ai/python/examples/agent/agents_as_tools/#running-the-agent)
Let’s run our agents! We can iterate over events as the workflow runs.

```


from llama_index.core.agent.workflow import (




AgentInput,




AgentOutput,




ToolCall,




ToolCallResult,




AgentStream,





from llama_index.core.workflow import Context




# Create a context for the orchestrator to hold history/state



ctx = Context(orchestrator)






asyncdefrun_orchestrator(ctx: Context, user_msg: str):




handler = orchestrator.run(




user_msg=user_msg,




ctx=ctx,






asyncfor event in handler.stream_events():




ifisinstance(event, AgentStream):




if event.delta:




print(event.delta, end="", flush=True)




# elif isinstance(event, AgentInput):




#     print("📥 Input:", event.input)




elifisinstance(event, AgentOutput):




# Skip printing the output since we are streaming above




# if event.response.content:




#     print("📤 Output:", event.response.content)




if event.tool_calls:




print(




"🛠️  Planning to use tools:",




[call.tool_name for call in event.tool_calls],





elifisinstance(event, ToolCallResult):




print(f"🔧 Tool Result ({event.tool_name}):")




print(f"  Arguments: {event.tool_kwargs}")




print(f"  Output: {event.tool_output}")




elifisinstance(event, ToolCall):




print(f"🔨 Calling Tool: {event.tool_name}")




print(f"  With arguments: {event.tool_kwargs}")


```


```


await run_orchestrator(




ctx=ctx,




user_msg=(




"Write me a report on the history of the internet. "




"Briefly describe the history of the internet, including the development of the internet, the development of the web, "




"and the development of the internet in the 21st century."
