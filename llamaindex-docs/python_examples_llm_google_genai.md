# Google GenAI 
In this notebook, we show how to use the `google-genai` Python SDK with LlamaIndex to interact with Google GenAI models.
If you’re opening this Notebook on colab, you will need to install LlamaIndex 🦙 and the `google-genai` Python SDK.

```


%pip install llama-index-llms-google-genai llama-index


```

## Basic Usage
[Section titled “Basic Usage”](https://developers.llamaindex.ai/python/framework/integrations/llm/google_genai/#basic-usage)
You will need to get an API key from [Google AI Studio](https://makersuite.google.com/app/apikey). Once you have one, you can either pass it explicity to the model, or use the `GOOGLE_API_KEY` environment variable.

```


import os





os.environ["GOOGLE_API_KEY"] ="..."


```

## Basic Usage
[Section titled “Basic Usage”](https://developers.llamaindex.ai/python/framework/integrations/llm/google_genai/#basic-usage-1)
You can call `complete` with a prompt:

```


from llama_index.llms.google_genai import GoogleGenAI





llm = GoogleGenAI(




model="gemini-2.5-flash",




# api_key="some key",  # uses GOOGLE_API_KEY env var by default






resp = llm.complete("Who is Paul Graham?")




print(resp)


```


```

```

assistant: Ahoy there, matey! Gather 'round, ye landlubbers, and listen to a tale that'll shiver yer timbers and curl yer toes! This be the story of One-Eyed Jack's Lost Parrot and the Great Mango Mayhem!



Now, One-Eyed Jack, bless his barnacle-encrusted heart, was a fearsome pirate, alright. He could bellow louder than a hurricane, swing a cutlass like a dervish, and drink rum like a fish. But he had a soft spot, see? A soft spot for his parrot, Polly. Polly wasn't just any parrot, mind ye. She could mimic the captain's every cuss word, predict the weather by the way she ruffled her feathers, and had a particular fondness for shiny trinkets.



One day, we were anchored off the coast of Mango Island, a lush paradise overflowing with the juiciest, sweetest mangoes ye ever did see. Jack, bless his greedy soul, decided we needed a cargo hold full of 'em. "For scurvy prevention!" he declared, winking with his good eye. More like for his own personal mango-eating contest, if ye ask me.



We stormed ashore, cutlasses gleaming, ready to plunder the mango groves. But Polly, the little feathered devil, decided she'd had enough of the ship. She squawked, "Shiny! Shiny!" and took off like a green streak towards the heart of the island.



Jack went ballistic! "Polly! Polly, ye feathered fiend! Get back here!" He chased after her, bellowing like a lovesick walrus. The rest of us, well, we were left to pick mangoes and try not to laugh ourselves silly.



Now, Mango Island wasn't just full of mangoes. It was also home to a tribe of mischievous monkeys, the Mango Marauders, they were called. They were notorious for their love of pranks and their uncanny ability to steal anything that wasn't nailed down.



Turns out, Polly had landed right in the middle of their territory. And those monkeys, they took one look at her shiny feathers and decided she was the perfect addition to their collection of stolen treasures. They snatched her up, chattering and screeching, and whisked her away to their hidden lair, a giant mango tree hollowed out by time.



Jack, bless his stubborn heart, followed the sound of Polly's squawks. He hacked through vines, dodged falling mangoes, and even wrestled a particularly grumpy iguana, all in pursuit of his feathered friend.



Finally, he reached the mango tree. He peered inside and saw Polly, surrounded by a horde of monkeys, all admiring her shiny feathers. And Polly? She was having the time of her life, mimicking the monkeys' chattering and stealing their mangoes!



Jack, instead of getting angry, started to laugh. A hearty, booming laugh that shook the very foundations of the tree. The monkeys, startled, dropped their mangoes and stared at him.



Then, Polly, seeing her captain, squawked, "Rum! Rum for everyone!"



And that, me hearties, is how One-Eyed Jack ended up sharing a barrel of rum with a tribe of mango-loving monkeys. We spent the rest of the day feasting on mangoes, drinking rum, and listening to Polly mimic the monkeys' antics. We even managed to fill the cargo hold with mangoes, though I suspect a good portion of them were already half-eaten by the monkeys.



So, the moral of the story, me lads? Even the fiercest pirate has a soft spot, and sometimes, the best treasures are the ones you least expect. And always, ALWAYS, keep an eye on yer parrot! Now, who's for another round of grog?

## Cached Content Support
[Section titled “Cached Content Support”](https://developers.llamaindex.ai/python/framework/integrations/llm/google_genai/#cached-content-support)
Google GenAI supports cached content for improved performance and cost efficiency when reusing large contexts across multiple requests. This is particularly useful for RAG applications, document analysis, and multi-turn conversations with consistent context.
#### Benefits
[Section titled “Benefits”](https://developers.llamaindex.ai/python/framework/integrations/llm/google_genai/#benefits)
  * **Faster responses**
  * **Cost savings** through reduced input token usage
  * **Consistent context** across multiple queries
  * **Perfect for document analysis** with large files


#### Creating Cached Content
[Section titled “Creating Cached Content”](https://developers.llamaindex.ai/python/framework/integrations/llm/google_genai/#creating-cached-content)
First, create cached content using the Google GenAI SDK:

```


from google import genai




from google.genai.types import CreateCachedContentConfig, Content, Part




import time





client = genai.Client(api_key="your-api-key")




# For VertexAI


# client = genai.Client(


#     http_options=HttpOptions(api_version="v1"),


#     project="your-project-id",


#     location="us-central1",


#     vertexai="True"


```

Option 1: Upload Local Files

```

# Upload and process local PDF files



pdf_file = client.files.upload(file="./your_document.pdf")




while pdf_file.state.name =="PROCESSING":




print("Waiting for PDF to be processed.")




time.sleep(2)




pdf_file = client.files.get(name=pdf_file.name)




# Create cache with uploaded file



cache = client.caches.create(




model="gemini-2.5-flash",




config=CreateCachedContentConfig(




display_name="Document Analysis Cache",




system_instruction=(




"You are an expert document analyzer. Answer questions "




"based on the provided documents with accuracy and detail."





contents=[pdf_file],  # Direct file reference




ttl="3600s"# Cache for 1 hour




```

Option 2: Multiple Files with Content Structure

```

# For multiple files or Cloud Storage files with VertexAI



contents = [




Content(




role="user",




parts=[




Part.from_uri(




# file_uri=pdf_file.uri,    # you can use the uploaded file's URI too




file_uri="gs://cloud-samples-data/generative-ai/pdf/2312.11805v3.pdf",




mime_type="application/pdf",





Part.from_uri(




file_uri="gs://cloud-samples-data/generative-ai/pdf/2403.05530.pdf",




mime_type="application/pdf",









cache = client.caches.create(




model="gemini-2.5-flash",




config=CreateCachedContentConfig(




display_name="Multi-Document Cache",




system_instruction=(




"You are an expert researcher. Analyze and compare "




"information across the provided documents."





contents=contents,




ttl="3600s",







print(f"Cache created: {cache.name}")




print(f"Cached tokens: {cache.usage_metadata.total_token_count}")


```


```

Cache created: projects/391.../locations/us-central1/cachedContents/267...


Cached tokens: 43102

```

Using Cached Content with LlamaIndex
Once you have created the cache, use it with LlamaIndex:

```


from llama_index.llms.google_genai import GoogleGenAI




from llama_index.core.llms import ChatMessage





llm = GoogleGenAI(




model="gemini-2.5-flash",




api_key="your-api-key",




cached_content=cache.name,





# For VertexAI


# llm = GoogleGenAI(


#     model="gemini-2.5-flash",


#     vertexai_config={"project": "your-project-id", "location": "us-central1"},


#     cached_content=cache.name




# Use the cached content



message = ChatMessage(




role="user", content="Summarize the key findings from Chapter 4."





response = llm.chat([message])




print(response)


```


```

assistant: Chapter 4, "The Abstraction: The Process," introduces the concept of a process as a running program, which is a fundamental abstraction provided by the operating system (OS). Here are the key findings:



1.  **Process Definition:** A process is essentially a running program, characterized by its machine state, including memory (address space), registers (including the program counter and stack pointer), and I/O information.



2.  **Process API:** The OS provides a process API that includes functions for creating processes (Create), destroying processes (Destroy), waiting for processes to complete (Wait), controlling processes (Miscellaneous Control), and obtaining status information (Status).



3.  **Process Creation:** Creating a process involves loading code and static data into memory, allocating memory for the stack and heap, initializing the stack, and then starting the program at its entry point (main()).



4.  **Process States:** A process can be in one of three states: Running (executing on a processor), Ready (ready to run but not currently running), or Blocked (waiting for an event, such as I/O completion).



5.  **Data Structures:** The OS maintains data structures, such as a process list, to track the state of each process. These structures contain information like the register context (saved register values) and the process state.



In essence, Chapter 4 lays the groundwork for understanding how the OS manages and virtualizes the CPU by introducing the concept of a process and its associated attributes and states.

```

Using Cached Content in Generation Config
For request-level caching control:

```


import google.genai.types as types




# Specify cached content per request



config = types.GenerateContentConfig(




cached_content=cache.name, temperature=0.1, max_output_tokens=1024






llm = GoogleGenAI(model="gemini-2.5-flash", generation_config=config)





response = llm.complete("List the first five chapters of the document")




print(response)


```


```

Here are the first five chapters of the document, as listed in the Table of Contents:



1.  A Dialogue on the Book


2.  Introduction to Operating Systems


3.  A Dialogue on Virtualization


4.  The Abstraction: The Process


5.  Interlude: Process API

```

Cache Management

```

# List all caches



caches = client.caches.list()




for cache_item in caches:




print(f"Cache: {cache_item.display_name} ({cache_item.name})")




print(f"Tokens: {cache_item.usage_metadata.total_token_count}")




# Get cache details



cache_info = client.caches.get(name=cache.name)




print(f"Created: {cache_info.create_time}")




print(f"Expires: {cache_info.expire_time}")




# Delete cache when done



client.caches.delete(name=cache.name)




print("Cache deleted")


```


```

Cache: Document Analysis Cache (cachedContents/8v3va2x...)


Tokens: 77421


Created: 2025-07-08 16:06:11.821190+00:00

## Structured Prediction
[Section titled “Structured Prediction”](https://developers.llamaindex.ai/python/framework/integrations/llm/google_genai/#structured-prediction)
LlamaIndex provides an intuitive interface for converting any LLM into a structured LLM through `structured_predict` - simply define the target Pydantic class (can be nested), and given a prompt, we extract out the desired object.

```


from llama_index.llms.google_genai import GoogleGenAI




from llama_index.core.prompts import PromptTemplate




from llama_index.core.bridge.pydantic import BaseModel




from typing import List






classMenuItem(BaseModel):




"""A menu item in a restaurant."""





course_name: str




is_vegetarian: bool






classRestaurant(BaseModel):




"""A restaurant with name, city, and cuisine."""





name: str




city: str




cuisine: str




menu_items: List[MenuItem]






llm = GoogleGenAI(model="gemini-2.5-flash")




prompt_tmpl = PromptTemplate(




"Generate a restaurant in a given city {city_name}"





# Option 1: Use `as_structured_llm`



restaurant_obj = (




llm.as_structured_llm(Restaurant)




.complete(prompt_tmpl.format(city_name="Miami"))





# Option 2: Use `structured_predict`


# restaurant_obj = llm.structured_predict(Restaurant, prompt_tmpl, city_name="Miami")

```


```


print(restaurant_obj)


```


```

name='Pasta Mia' city='Miami' cuisine='Italian' menu_items=[MenuItem(course_name='pasta', is_vegetarian=False)]

```

#### Structured Prediction with Streaming
[Section titled “Structured Prediction with Streaming”](https://developers.llamaindex.ai/python/framework/integrations/llm/google_genai/#structured-prediction-with-streaming)
Any LLM wrapped with `as_structured_llm` supports streaming through `stream_chat`.

```


from llama_index.core.llms import ChatMessage




from IPython.display import clear_output




from pprint import pprint





input_msg = ChatMessage.from_str("Generate a restaurant in San Francisco")





sllm = llm.as_structured_llm(Restaurant)




stream_output = sllm.stream_chat([input_msg])




for partial_output in stream_output:




clear_output(wait=True)




pprint(partial_output.raw.dict())




restaurant_obj = partial_output.raw




restaurant_obj

```


```

{'city': 'San Francisco',



'cuisine': 'Italian',




'menu_items': [{'course_name': 'pasta', 'is_vegetarian': False}],




'name': 'Italian Delight'}





/var/folders/lw/xwsz_3yj4ln1gvkxhyddbvvw0000gn/T/ipykernel_76091/1885953561.py:11: PydanticDeprecatedSince20: The `dict` method is deprecated; use `model_dump` instead. Deprecated in Pydantic V2.0 to be removed in V3.0. See Pydantic V2 Migration Guide at https://errors.pydantic.dev/2.10/migration/



pprint(partial_output.raw.dict())








Restaurant(name='Italian Delight', city='San Francisco', cuisine='Italian', menu_items=[MenuItem(course_name='pasta', is_vegetarian=False)])

```

## Tool/Function Calling
[Section titled “Tool/Function Calling”](https://developers.llamaindex.ai/python/framework/integrations/llm/google_genai/#toolfunction-calling)
Google GenAI supports direct tool/function calling through the API. Using LlamaIndex, we can implement some core agentic tool calling patterns.

```


from llama_index.core.tools import FunctionTool




from llama_index.core.llms import ChatMessage




from llama_index.llms.google_genai import GoogleGenAI




from datetime import datetime





llm = GoogleGenAI(model="gemini-2.5-flash")






defget_current_time(timezone: str) -> dict:




"""Get the current time"""




return {




"time": datetime.now().strftime("%Y-%m-%d %H:%M:%S"),




"timezone": timezone,






# uses the tool name, any type annotations, and docstring to describe the tool



tool = FunctionTool.from_defaults(fn=get_current_time)


```

We can simply do a single pass to call the tool and get the result:

```


resp = llm.predict_and_call([tool], "What is the current time in New York?")




print(resp)


```


```

{'time': '2025-03-14 10:59:05', 'timezone': 'America/New_York'}

```

We can also use lower-level APIs to implement an agentic tool-calling loop!

We can also call multiple tools simultaneously in a single request, making it efficient for complex queries that require different types of information.

## Google Search Grounding
[Section titled “Google Search Grounding”](https://developers.llamaindex.ai/python/framework/integrations/llm/google_genai/#google-search-grounding)
Google Gemini 2.0 and 2.5 models support Google Search grounding, which allows the model to search for real-time information and ground its responses with web search results. This is particularly useful for getting up-to-date information.
The `built_in_tool` parameter accepts Google Search tools that enable the model to ground its responses with real-world data from Google Search results.

```


from llama_index.llms.google_genai import GoogleGenAI




from llama_index.core.llms import ChatMessage




from google.genai import types




# Create Google Search grounding tool



grounding_tool = types.Tool(google_search=types.GoogleSearch())





llm = GoogleGenAI(




model="gemini-2.5-flash",




built_in_tool=grounding_tool,






resp = llm.complete("When is the next total solar eclipse in the US?")




print(resp)


```


```

The next total solar eclipse visible in the United States will occur on August 23, 2044. However, totality will only be visible in Montana, North Dakota, and South Dakota. Another total solar eclipse will occur on August 12, 2045, with a path spanning from California to Florida.

```

The Google Search grounding tool provides several benefits:
  * **Real-time information** : Access to current events and up-to-date data
  * **Factual accuracy** : Responses grounded in actual search results
  * **Source attribution** : Grounding metadata includes search sources
  * **Automatic search decisions** : The model determines when to search based on the query


You can also use the grounding tool with chat messages:

```

# Using Google Search with chat messages



messages = [ChatMessage(role="user", content="Who won the Euro 2024?")]





resp = llm.chat(messages)




print(resp)




# You can access grounding metadata from the raw response



ifhasattr(resp, "raw") and"grounding_metadata"in resp.raw:




print(resp.raw["grounding_metadata"])




else:




print("\nNo grounding metadata in this response")


```


```

assistant: Spain won Euro 2024, defeating England 2-1 in the final. The match took place at the Olympiastadion in Berlin. This victory marks Spain's fourth European Championship title, surpassing Germany for the most wins in the competition.

## Code Execution
[Section titled “Code Execution”](https://developers.llamaindex.ai/python/framework/integrations/llm/google_genai/#code-execution)
The `built_in_tool` parameter also accepts code execution tools that enable the model to write and execute Python code to solve problems, perform calculations, and analyze data. This is particularly useful for mathematical computations, data analysis, and generating visualizations.

```


from llama_index.llms.google_genai import GoogleGenAI




from llama_index.core.llms import ChatMessage




from google.genai import types




# Create code execution tool



code_execution_tool = types.Tool(code_execution=types.ToolCodeExecution())





llm = GoogleGenAI(




model="gemini-2.5-flash",




built_in_tool=code_execution_tool,






resp = llm.complete("Calculate 20th fibonacci number.")




print(resp)


```


```

Okay, I can calculate the 20th Fibonacci number. I will use a python script to do this.




The 20th Fibonacci number is 6765.

```

### Accessing Code Execution Details
[Section titled “Accessing Code Execution Details”](https://developers.llamaindex.ai/python/framework/integrations/llm/google_genai/#accessing-code-execution-details)
When the model uses code execution, you can access the executed code, results, and other metadata through the raw response. This includes:
  * **executable_code** : The actual Python code that was executed
  * **code_execution_result** : The output from running the code
  * **text** : The model’s explanation and commentary


Let’s see this in action:

```

# Request a calculation that will likely use code execution



messages = [




ChatMessage(




role="user", content="What is the sum of the first 50 prime numbers?"







resp = llm.chat(messages)




# Access the raw response to see code execution details



ifhasattr(resp, "raw") and"content"in resp.raw:




parts = resp.raw["content"].get("parts", [])





for i, part inenumerate(parts):




print(f"Part {i+1}:")





if"text"in part and part["text"]:




print(f"  Text: {part['text'][:100]}", end="")




print(" ..."iflen(part["text"]) 100else"")





if"executable_code"in part and part["executable_code"]:




print(f"  Executable Code: {part['executable_code']}")





if"code_execution_result"in part and part["code_execution_result"]:




print(f"  Code Result: {part['code_execution_result']}")




else:




print("No detailed parts found in raw response")


```


```

Part 1:



Text: Okay, I need to calculate the sum of the first 50 prime numbers. I can use a python script to genera ...



Part 2:



Executable Code: {'code': "def is_prime(n):\n    if n <= 1:\n        return False\n    if n <= 3:\n        return True\n    if n % 2 == 0 or n % 3 == 0:\n        return False\n    i = 5\n    while i * i <= n:\n        if n % i == 0 or n % (i + 2) == 0:\n            return False\n        i += 6\n    return True\n\nprimes = []\nnum = 2\nwhile len(primes) < 50:\n    if is_prime(num):\n        primes.append(num)\n    num += 1\n\nprint(f'{sum(primes)=}')\n", 'language': <Language.PYTHON: 'PYTHON'>}



Part 3:



Code Result: {'outcome': <Outcome.OUTCOME_OK: 'OUTCOME_OK'>, 'output': 'sum(primes)=5117\n'}



Part 4:



Text: The sum of the first 50 prime numbers is 5117.


```

## Image Generation
[Section titled “Image Generation”](https://developers.llamaindex.ai/python/framework/integrations/llm/google_genai/#image-generation)
Select models also support image outputs, as well as image inputs. Using the `response_modalities` config, we can generate and edit images with a Gemini model!

```


from llama_index.llms.google_genai import GoogleGenAI




import google.genai.types as types





config = types.GenerateContentConfig(




temperature=0.1, response_modalities=["Text", "Image"]






llm = GoogleGenAI(




model="gemini-2.5-flash-image-preview", generation_config=config



```


```


from llama_index.core.llms import ChatMessage, TextBlock, ImageBlock





messages = [




ChatMessage(role="user", content="Please generate an image of a cute dog")






resp = llm.chat(messages)


```


```


fromPILimport Image




from IPython.display import display





for block in resp.message.blocks:




ifisinstance(block, ImageBlock):




image = Image.open(block.resolve_image())




display(image)




elifisinstance(block, TextBlock):




print(block.text)


```


```

Here's a cute dog for you!

```

We can also edit the image!

```

messages.append(resp.message)


messages.append(



ChatMessage(




role="user",




content="Please edit the image to make the dog a mini-schnauzer, but keep the same overall pose, framing, background, and art style.",







resp = llm.chat(messages)





for block in resp.message.blocks:




ifisinstance(block, ImageBlock):




image = Image.open(block.resolve_image())




display(image)




elifisinstance(block, TextBlock):




print(block.text)


```


```

Here's your mini-schnauzer!
