ResNet, short for **Residual Network**, is a type of deep neural network architecture introduced by Microsoft Research in 2015 in the paper *"Deep Residual Learning for Image Recognition"* by Kaiming He et al. It became famous after winning the **ImageNet Large Scale Visual Recognition Challenge ( al.

### **Key idea**


The main innovation of ResNet is the concept of **residual learning** using **skip connections** (or shortcut connections). In very the concept of **residual learning** using **skip connections** (or shortcut connections). In very deep neural networks, performance can degrade because of the **vanishing/exploding gradient problem deep neural networks, performance can degrade because of the **vanishing/exploding gradient problem** and difficulty in optimization. ResNet solves this by letting certain layers "skip" forward in** and difficulty in optimization. ResNet solves this by letting certain layers "skip" forward in the network through identity mappings.



A *residual block the network through identity mappings.



A *residual block* looks like this:

Instead of directly learning a mapping connection)




Instead of directly learning a mapping \( H(x) \), the residual block learns \( F(x) \( H(x) \), the residual block learns \( F(x) = H(x) - x \), so that:



H(x) = F(x) + x



Here = H(x) - x \), so that:



H(x) = F(x) + x



Here, \( x \) is added directly to the output of the block, enabling easier gradient flow, \( x \) is added directly to the output of the block, enabling easier gradient flow and allowing training of and allowing training of

# Deep Learning: A Brief Explanation



Deep learning is a subset of machine learning that uses neural networks with multiple layers (hence "deep") to analyze data and make predictions.



## Key Characteristics:



- **Neural Networks**: Inspired by the human brain, these networks consist of interconnected nodes (neurons) organized in layers


- **Automatic Feature Extraction**: Unlike traditional ML, deep learning automatically discovers important features in data without manual engineering


- **Hierarchical Learning**: Lower layers learn simple patterns while deeper layers combine these to recognize complex concepts


- **Large Data Requirements**: Typically needs substantial amounts of data to perform well



Deep learning powers many modern technologies including image recognition, natural language processing, speech recognition, and recommendation systems. Its effectiveness comes from its ability to model highly complex relationships in data, though this often requires significant computational resources.
