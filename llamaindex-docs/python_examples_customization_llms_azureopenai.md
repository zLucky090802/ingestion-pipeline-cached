# Azure OpenAI 
Azure openAI resources unfortunately differ from standard openAI resources as you can’t generate embeddings unless you use an embedding model. The regions where these models are available can be found here: <https://learn.microsoft.com/en-us/azure/cognitive-services/openai/concepts/models#embeddings-models>
Furthermore the regions that support embedding models unfortunately don’t support the latest versions (<*>-003) of openAI models, so we are forced to use one region for embeddings and another for the text generation.
If you’re opening this Notebook on colab, you will probably need to install LlamaIndex 🦙.

```


%pip install llama-index-embeddings-azure-openai




%pip install llama-index-llms-azure-openai


```


```


!pip install llama-index


```


```


from llama_index.llms.azure_openai import AzureOpenAI




from llama_index.embeddings.azure_openai import AzureOpenAIEmbedding




from llama_index.core import VectorStoreIndex, SimpleDirectoryReader




import logging




import sys




logging.basicConfig(



stream=sys.stdout, level=logging.INFO




# logging.DEBUG for more verbose output




logging.getLogger().addHandler(logging.StreamHandler(stream=sys.stdout))


```

Here, we setup the embedding model (for retrieval) and llm (for text generation). Note that you need not only model names (e.g. “text-embedding-ada-002”), but also model deployment names (the one you chose when deploying the model in Azure. You must pass the deployment name as a parameter when you initialize `AzureOpenAI` and `OpenAIEmbedding`.
