# Run Your Workflow as a Server
The `workflows` library includes a `WorkflowServer` class that allows you to easily expose your workflows over an HTTP API. This provides a flexible way to run and manage workflows from any HTTP-capable client.
Additionally, the `WorkflowServer` is deployed with a static debugging application that allows you to visualize, run, and debug workflows. This is automatically mounted at the root `/` path of the running server.
## Installation
[Section titled “Installation”](https://developers.llamaindex.ai/python/llamaagents/workflows/deployment/#installation)
The workflow server is a separate package from the core `llama-index-workflows` library:
Terminal window
```


pipinstallllama-agents-server


```

## Programmatic Usage
[Section titled “Programmatic Usage”](https://developers.llamaindex.ai/python/llamaagents/workflows/deployment/#programmatic-usage)
You can create a server, add your workflows, and run it programmatically. This is useful when you want to embed the workflow server in a larger application.
First, create a Python file (e.g., `my_server.py`):
my_server.py
```


import asyncio




from workflows import Workflow, step




from workflows.context import Context




from workflows.events import Event, StartEvent, StopEvent




from llama_agents.server import WorkflowServer






classStreamEvent(Event):




sequence: int





# Define a simple workflow



classGreetingWorkflow(Workflow):




@step




asyncdefgreet(self, ctx: Context, ev: StartEvent) -> StopEvent:




forinrange(3):




ctx.write_event_to_stream(StreamEvent(sequence=i))




await asyncio.sleep(0.3)





name = ev.get("name", "World")




return StopEvent(result=f"Hello, {name}!")





greet_wf = GreetingWorkflow()





# Create a server instance



server = WorkflowServer()




# Add the workflow to the server



server.add_workflow("greet", greet_wf)




# To run the server programmatically (e.g., from your own script)


# import asyncio



# async def main():


#     await server.serve(host="0.0.0.0", port=8080)



# if __name__ == "__main__":


#     asyncio.run(main())

```

## Command-Line Interface (CLI)
[Section titled “Command-Line Interface (CLI)”](https://developers.llamaindex.ai/python/llamaagents/workflows/deployment/#command-line-interface-cli)
The library also provides a convenient CLI to run a server from a file containing a `WorkflowServer` instance.
Given the `my_server.py` file from the example above, you can start the server with the following command:
Terminal window
```


python-mworkflows.servermy_server.py


```

The server will start on `0.0.0.0:8080` by default. You can configure the host and port using the `WORKFLOWS_PY_SERVER_HOST` and `WORKFLOWS_PY_SERVER_PORT` environment variables.
## Workflow Debugger UI
[Section titled “Workflow Debugger UI”](https://developers.llamaindex.ai/python/llamaagents/workflows/deployment/#workflow-debugger-ui)
The `WorkflowServer` is deployed with a static debugging application that allows you to visualize, run, and debug workflows. This is automatically mounted at the root `/` path of the running server.
The Workflow Debugging UI offers a few key features:
  * **Workflow Visualization** : The UI provides a visual representation of the workflow’s structure both statically and while it is running. You can re-arrange the nodes as needed.
  * **Automatic schema detection** : If you customize the schemas of your start/stop events, or internal events, the UI will automatically detect and display UI appropriate for the schema.
  * **Human-in-the-loop** : While a workflow is running, you can send any event into the workflow. This is useful for workflows that rely on human input to continue execution. See the `Send Event` button on the top of the events log.
  * **Events Log** : All streamed events are logged in the UI, allowing you to inspect the workflow’s execution in real-time in the right side-panel.
  * **Multiple Runs** : Debug and compare multiple runs. Each time you run a workflow, the left-side panel tracks that run.
  * **Multiple Workflows** : The UI will let you run any workflow that is mounted within the `WorkflowServer`.


### Handling “Hidden” Events
[Section titled “Handling “Hidden” Events”](https://developers.llamaindex.ai/python/llamaagents/workflows/deployment/#handling-hidden-events)
Sometimes, workflows will send/accept events that are annotated in the workflow (like using `ctx.wait_for_event()`). In these cases, you can still inform the UI about these events using the `server.add_workflow(..., additional_events=[...])` API to inject those events. Then, UI elements like the `Send Event` functionality will be aware of these events.
## API Endpoints
[Section titled “API Endpoints”](https://developers.llamaindex.ai/python/llamaagents/workflows/deployment/#api-endpoints)
The `WorkflowServer` exposes the following RESTful endpoints:  
| Method  | Path  | Description  |  
| --- | --- | --- |  
| `GET`  | `/health`  | Returns a health check response (`{"status": "healthy"}`).  |  
| `GET`  | `/workflows`  | Lists the names of all registered workflows.  |  
| `POST`  | `/workflows/{name}/run`  | Runs the specified workflow synchronously and returns the final result.  |  
| `POST`  | `/workflows/{name}/run-nowait`  | Starts the specified workflow asynchronously and returns a `handler_id`.  |  
| `GET`  | `/handlers/{handler_id}`  | Retrieves the result of an asynchronously run workflow. Returns `202 Accepted` if still running, `500` if the workflow failed, `200` if the workflow completed.  |  
| `GET`  | `/events/{handler_id}`  | Streams all events from a running workflow as newline-delimited JSON (`application/x-ndjson` and `text/event-stream` if SSE are enabled).  |  
| `POST`  | `/events/{handler_id}`  | Sends an event to a workflow during its execution (useful for human-in-the-loop)  |  
| `GET`  | `/handlers`  | Get all the workflow handlers (running and completed)  |  
| `POST`  | `/handlers/{handler_id}/cancel`  | Stop and cancel the execution of a workflow.  |  
### Running a Workflow (`/run`)
[Section titled “Running a Workflow (/run)”](https://developers.llamaindex.ai/python/llamaagents/workflows/deployment/#running-a-workflow-run)
To run a workflow and wait for its completion, send a `POST` request to `/workflows/{name}/run`.
**Request Body:**

```



"start_event": {},




"context": {},




"handler_id": "",



```

  * `start_event`: serialized representation of a StartEvent or a subclass of it. Using this as a workflow input is recommended.
  * `context`: serialized representation of the workflow context
  * `handler_id`: workflow handler identifier to continue from a previous completed run.


**Successful Response (`200 OK`):**

```



"result": "The workflow has been successfully run"



```

### Running a Workflow Asynchronously (`/run-nowait`)
[Section titled “Running a Workflow Asynchronously (/run-nowait)”](https://developers.llamaindex.ai/python/llamaagents/workflows/deployment/#running-a-workflow-asynchronously-run-nowait)
To start a workflow without waiting for it to finish, use the `/run-nowait` endpoint.
**Request Body:**

```



"start_event": {},




"context": {},




"handler_id": ""



```

The request body has the same arguments as the `/run` endpoint.
**Successful Response (`200 OK`):**

```



"handler_id": "someUniqueId123",




"status": "started"



```

You can then use the `handler_id` to check for the result or stream events.
## Streaming events (`GET /events/{handler_id}`)
[Section titled “Streaming events (GET /events/{handler_id})”](https://developers.llamaindex.ai/python/llamaagents/workflows/deployment/#streaming-events-get-eventshandler_id)
> _This endpoint only works if you previously started a workflow asynchronously with`/run-nowait`_
To stream events either as Server-Sent Events (SSE) or as multi-line JSON payloads, you can send a request to the `/events/{handler_id}` endpoint with the handler ID of an asynchronous workflow run you previously started.
**Query parameters**
  * `sse` (set to either “true” or “false”, not required): stream the events as Server Sent Events (`text/event-stream`) if true, else stream them as a multi-line JSON payload (`application/x-ndjson`). Defaults to true.
  * `acquire_timeout` (a float-convertible string, not required): timeout for acquiring the lock to iterate over events
  * `include_internal` (set to either “true” or “false”, not required): stream internal workfloe events if set to true. Defaults to false.
  * `include_qualified_name` (set to either “true” or “false”, not required): include the qualified name of the event in the response body. Defaults to true.


**Example request**
Terminal window
```


curlhttp://localhost:80/events/someUniqueId123?sse=false&acquire_timeout=1&include_internal=false&include_qualified_name=true


```

**Successful response (`200 OK`)**
Single event payload:

```



"value": {"result": 12},




"qualified_name": "__main__.MathEvent",




"type": "__main__.MathEvent",




"types": ["workflows.events.Event", "__main__.MathEvent"],



```

**Important considerations**
  * Only one reader is allowed to stream the events per workflow run
  * Once the events have been streamed, they cannot be recovered (unless you implemented some persistence logic on the client side)


> _We are working to improve both these aspects, so changes in the server behavior might be expected_
## Getting the result from a workflow execution (`/results/{handler_id}`)
[Section titled “Getting the result from a workflow execution (/results/{handler_id})”](https://developers.llamaindex.ai/python/llamaagents/workflows/deployment/#getting-the-result-from-a-workflow-execution-resultshandler_id)
> _This endpoint only works if you previously started a workflow asynchronously with`/run-nowait`_
To get the result of a previously started asynchronous workflow run, you can use the `/results/{handler_id}` endpoint passing the handler ID of the run.
**Example request**
Terminal window
```


curlhttp://localhost:80/results/someUniqueId123


```

**Successful response (`200 OK`)**

```



"handler_id": "someUniqueId123",




"workflow_name": "math_workflow",




"run_id": "uniqueRunId456",




"error": null,




"result": {




"sum": 15,




"subtraction": 9,




"multiplication": 36,




"division": 4,





"status": "completed",




"started_at": "2024-10-21T14:32:15.123Z",




"updated_at": "2024-10-21T14:45:30.456Z",




"completed_at": "2024-10-21T14:45:30.456Z"



```

**Accepted response (`202 ACCEPTED`)**
Status code `202` is returned when the workflow is still running, and thus has not produce a result yet.
## Sending an event (`POST /events/{handler_id}`)
[Section titled “Sending an event (POST /events/{handler_id})”](https://developers.llamaindex.ai/python/llamaagents/workflows/deployment/#sending-an-event-post-eventshandler_id)
In cases where external input is needed for the workflow to run (human in the loop, e.g.), you can send a POST request to the `events/{handler_id}` endpoint with the event data to send (and, optionally, the step of the workflow to send them to) in order to provide said external input.
**Request body**

```



"event": {"__is_pydantic": true, "value": {"feedback": "This is great!", "approved": true}, "qualified_name": "__main__.HumanFeedbackEvent"},




"step": "process_human_feedback"



```

  * `event`: serialized representation of a workflow Event.
  * `step` (optional): name of the step to send the event to.


**Successful response (`200 OK`)**

```



"status": "sent"



```

## Canceling a workflow run (`/handlers/{handler_id}/cancel`)
[Section titled “Canceling a workflow run (/handlers/{handler_id}/cancel)”](https://developers.llamaindex.ai/python/llamaagents/workflows/deployment/#canceling-a-workflow-run-handlershandler_idcancel)
To stop a running workflow handler by cancelling its tasks, and optionally removing the associated handler from the persistence store, you can use `/handlers/{handler_id}/cancel`.
**Query parameters**
  * `purge` (can be set to either “true” or “false”, not required): whether or not to remove the handler associated with the workflow from the persistence store. Defaults to false.


**Example request**
Terminal window
```


curl-XPOSThttp://localhost:80/handlers/someUniqueId123/cancel?purge=true


```

**Successful response (`200 OK`)**

```



"status": "deleted", // or canceled if purge is false



```

## Persistence
[Section titled “Persistence”](https://developers.llamaindex.ai/python/llamaagents/workflows/deployment/#persistence)
By default, `WorkflowServer` uses an in-memory store (`MemoryWorkflowStore`), so all handler state and events are lost when the process restarts. For durable persistence, pass a `workflow_store` backed by a database.
### SQLite
[Section titled “SQLite”](https://developers.llamaindex.ai/python/llamaagents/workflows/deployment/#sqlite)
The simplest option for single-process deployments is `SqliteWorkflowStore`, which persists handler state, events, and results to a local file:

```


from llama_agents.server import WorkflowServer, SqliteWorkflowStore





store = SqliteWorkflowStore(db_path="workflows.db")





server = WorkflowServer(workflow_store=store)




server.add_workflow("greet", greet_wf)


```

### DBOS (Postgres)
[Section titled “DBOS (Postgres)”](https://developers.llamaindex.ai/python/llamaagents/workflows/deployment/#dbos-postgres)
For production deployments that need Postgres-backed persistence, durable execution, and the ability to run distributed workers, use the `DBOSRuntime` from the `llama-agents-dbos` package. This replaces the default runtime with one backed by [DBOS](https://docs.dbos.dev/), providing transactional state management and recovery across process restarts:

```


from dbos importDBOS




from llama_agents.dbos import DBOSRuntime




from llama_agents.server import WorkflowServer




# Configure DBOS — uses SQLite by default, or set system_database_url for Postgres



DBOS(config={"name": "my-app", "run_admin_server": False})





runtime = DBOSRuntime()





server = WorkflowServer(




workflow_store=runtime.create_workflow_store(),




runtime=runtime.build_server_runtime(),





server.add_workflow("greet", GreetingWorkflow())


```

By default DBOS uses SQLite (zero setup). To use Postgres, pass a `system_database_url` in the DBOS config. For multi-replica setups, each replica must have a unique `executor_id`:

```


DBOS(config={




"name": "my-app",




"system_database_url": "postgresql://user:pass@localhost:5432/mydb",




"run_admin_server": False,




"executor_id": "replica-1"# unique per replica



```

With Postgres, multiple server replicas can share the same database for distributed execution and recovery. See the `examples/dbos/` directory for a full multi-replica demo.
## Python Client
[Section titled “Python Client”](https://developers.llamaindex.ai/python/llamaagents/workflows/deployment/#python-client)
For programmatic interaction with a `WorkflowServer`, see the [Python Client](https://developers.llamaindex.ai/python/llamaagents/workflows/client) documentation.
